1,Enjoy while it lasts,This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon. Hope this review is published and not eventually deleted however this review would not be as detailed as the previous one. Purchased this product in Aug 2020 and since then had 3 replacements from Boat within a year. Each unit would last 3 to 4 months max depending upon the usage and always one or the other earpiece would die out. The left earpiece of the 3rd replacement died out 2 days back. Please note I have mostly used them during my morning jogging/running. Over all the sound quality is good and enjoy them as long as they last but the overall durability of the device is very very poor. Attaching the 3 earpiece chargers as a proof.,2.0 
2,Good,"1. Quite good look2. Better noise cancellation, good base.3. Quite lighter, fixes in the ear well4. Inspite having bluetooth 5.0, Doesn't connect to two Device at same time. I had bought it to use it with my honor smart watch along with my mobile but couldn't do so.5. No charging cable, No ear buds of different size, Nothing extraa given.Can't comment on battery backup. Seemed good.",4.0 
3,not great,"its a good set of ear buds but1. the quality of sound gets bad when connected with macbook2. due to absence of dual mic noise cancellation, it becomes very difficult to use it during a call as the other person hears lot of envt. noiseinability to use it during the call is the one big major disadvantage for this pair but other features are good like instant connection with mobile etc",1.0 
4,Best buds in the budget with Type C,"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! 🎯For other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! 🙂Happy Listening! 🎶",5.0 
5,Some unwanted noise from the left ear bud.,I received the product with some defect. The left side of the airdops was making unwanted sound which is irritating after each and every small  input.,1.0 
6,Amazon deleting my review.,"Boat AirDopes, have by far been the most champion looking TWS that I have invested in. However, it makes me feel that the premium looks are simply to deceive the customers from other core issues that thus TWS has.1. Connectivity: The connectivity is very poor and there is a lag between the video and audio.2. Battery: The right earphones, just don't charge. So, I have been using just one TWS since about 2-3 months.3. Warranty: There is no warranty on the product, and team boat never ever replies. It's absolutely impossible to get in touch with them. They are almost invisible. The aftersale services have been the worst. Actually, non existent.4. Amazon: This is the 4th review that I am writing. Amazon has been consistently deleting my reviews.",1.0 
7,Poor quality product,Worst product plz don't buy it you will regret buying it for sure. My left ear bud not working just brought it previous month.,1.0 
8,Too much price for these not poor pair of Earbuds.,"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.",1.0 
9,Below average,"The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.",2.0 
10,There is a PROBLEM with earbuds!! REPLACEMENT also has same.,"I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best. But this noise has made me dislike the product. Sorry. Returning it.",2.0 
11,"Don't go with the rating, not worth a penny","Honest review after replacing the first assuming may be received a faulty product, the second was even worst. 1st the call quality was terrible absolutely no clear voice. No bass at all. So did a replacement the second had the same problem. Second one the left ear bud had stopped working. Did a reset still no use.",1.0 
12,defective left ear piece. You may be next victim of this.,defective left ear piece. Cracking sound on standby. Right side was ok. Very bad service from amazon. Left me with a loss of  500 rs after refund. I wanted a replacement but amzon denied the option as stock is limited. Never going to use amazon again.,1.0 
13,Really Good product,"* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.**** Battery🔋 review (after 2 weeks)Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6½ hrs.Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.",5.0 
14,Below expectation,"From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it’s not that bad.The noise cancellation is not there at all.These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket.",1.0

16,Must buy if you are a basshead,"If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.Battery Life: 4/5Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids  are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)Note: I am now 7 months into using this. The earphones still work with the same quality as received. However, there's a little glitch. Whenever the battery percentage drops by 10 or 20 per cent, it seems to disconnect. It reconnects automatically, but it can get annoying. Doesn't happen every time, but there's a frequency. Tried calling on these earphones as well. Good quality. Earphones run for at least 3.5 hours and a single battery charge for the case gives at least 3-4 charges. So, all in all, good.",5.0 
17,Worst experience with Boat 441 Airdopes. Feels cheated by the seller and Amazon for the first time.,I am really having such a bad experience using this Boat Airdopes 441 product. I ordered it on 10th June 2020. It's  28th and my left ear buds gets discharge in less than 10 minutes. I tried everything possible to cure the problem. I am not able to even factory reset it. The seller  has closed the window of return. It's my third Boat's product but I am having really tough time with this third one. I don't know what to do. Product is under 1 year warranty but does it worth having a product which cannot even work properly for 15-20 days.,1.0 
18,Good...,"Hi All,I have both 311 and 441, compare to both I feel 441 is compact.Cons* No battery indication.* If someone has big finger like me will feel hard to take out earpods.* Gets connect as soon as you open lid of box.Prons* Touch is really good* Not heavy and don't feel pain after using for 4 hours* bass is good but not good as 311.",4.0

22,Wrong information,In the picture it shows the boat symbol on airdopes but On my airdopes it is written boat I don’t have an idea about it. The photo doesn’t relate the product. This is an illegal offence of cheating.,3.0 
23,Weird sound coming from left airdopes for every input. Uneasy to use,Some Weird Sound coming from left airdope for every small input which makes uneasy to use it. Also observed that some more time taken to charge and drains fast left side airdopes. Seems faulty peace. After waited for so many days to get delivery I got faulty peace. I am very much disappointed,1.0 
24,Customer service of BoAt sucks. I'm highly frustrated now.,"I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.😠 Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer. After replacing 2 times and waiting to receive a good product for more than 4 months of purchasing it still I'm hankering for it.All I wanted is to let you all know my experience with these airdopes. Now i literally realize that I wouldn't have purchased this product at all. I should have gone for some wired earphones which is far better than these or would have gone for some other company. I'm being cheated by Boat again and again.Customer service sucks... Neither they test a faulty product properly nor they test the one sending as a replacement. Then my question is why are they sitting over there?? Why they take so much of time to get us the replacement???",1.0

Yes, the mic is worse the other person will hear a hissing sound while on call, I tested this multiple times the mic is really bad.Another issue is you cannot connect it to multiple devices, only 1 device will be connected at a time, now imagine you have airdopes connected to the laptop and if you want to receive a call, you will have to reconnect the boat airdopes to the phone.And On Top of this, there is no refund available on a replacement.",1.0 
30,Worth every penny,"The product is great in terms of build quality,sound and noise cancellation.Even the touch response is excellent so you don't have to pull your smartphone each time to change a song.About the battery it's pretty much good as it last for about 3-4 hours of continuous usage.The major feature is the bluetooth connectivity where you need not wait for pairing each time ,once BT switched on it automatically connects.!!!Just order without any hesitation and you will realise the value for money of this product",5.0

39,Left earbud noise,"Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine. But on the third day the connectivity started getting distorted even in the next room even with bending and moving. That was very disappointing. Also there was a constant tr tr tr.. noise in the left ear bud which is very low but it is noticeable. This noise only comes when the music is on. When the media stops playing the noise also stops. The voice calling is extremely poor. The person on the line will get a lot of background noise and the voice gets cracked, it was a very bad experience. So it is only suitable for listening to media. Ordered replacement. Hope the problem does not persist in the replaced model too.UPDATE : Got the replacement. The left bud noise is still there. It is lower than the previous pair. It seems like the problem persists in all products of this model. Think just have to ignore the noise.",1.0 
40,its pretty good,"The good:+ Connection is alright+ Build quality+ Touch controls+ Sound quality is also not bad+ Battery life+ Battery bank feature and type c charging are very welcomeThe bad:- THERE IS A CONSTANT STATIC IN THE LEFT EARBUD, its not noticeable when anything is playing but as soon as you pause audio its right there. Tolerable, but annoying.- Too big for small ear- Design makes it so the wings can irritate the inside of your ears if you're moving around.- Way too much bass, balanced sound is out of the window.",3.0 
41,Static noise,"Static hiss in the left earpiece when connected to device but no music is being played. Must be some manufacturing defect in the batch because the same problem arose in the replaced product. Other than for  this reason its a great product, good looks ,comfortable and nice sound.Have been using boat products for a while now so a little disappointed with this product.*many wont even mind the hiss,but its annoying once you notice it.** 5 stars for Amazon for quick delivery ,replacement and customer service.",1.0 
42,First buy review,"Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to  crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.Hopefully in long run the review holds true!",5.0 
43,For deep bass lovers a perfect earbud,I had literally tried 5 Bluetooth earbuds before buying it and finally my search ends here. I am a deep bass lover and it has not disappointed me at all. Call quality is not good. If u want to buy it for frequent calls don't go for it. But if u can compromise on calling it is the best earbud....beleive me i had bought earbuds upto 5k....it is best in all of them!!,4.0 
44,Voice cancellation works in reverse order,"If you are looking for calls please don’t buy this product, the voice cancellation is pathetic. It reduces your voice and increases background voice the other person can’t hear you at all.If you are looking only to hear music and video then you may buy this product.",1.0 
45,Defective piece. - Buzzing sound from left earpirce. - Again after replacement.,"Got the product on 3rd Oct and by looking at the previous negative comments, there seems to be a quality issue with this specific model where there is a static buzzing sound coming from the left earpiece.>have tried different phones/tablet/pc - its happening on all of the device even after performing a factory reset of the earphones.Hope the replacement works fine.Edit:Got the replacement earpiece today and the issue is still there on the left earpiece so matter which device i connect to.Went thru other 1 star review and it looks like many people are facing the same issue with their product.seems to be a manufacturing defect.Returned it for refund.Avoid buying boAt products online and if u really have to, get it offline before testing it on the spot!",1.0 
46,Awesome earbuds,"Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.",5.0 
47,Please view,It disconnects very often....its very disturbing while playing games or attending a call....had a great experience with boat....but this time i was surprisingly very dissapointed...sound quality is good but 😢😢,1.0 
48,Bad experience,"I had lot of expectations on this product but sound quality is not very good and there is lag of one or two seconds while listening music.Call quality is very bad, if you are using this for calling purpose, please don’t go for it.If you use both of ear dopes at same time, there are high chances of one battery is going of and other is working, it shows the battery level are not in sync.",1.0 
49,Read before you buy!!,"No noise cancellation, maximum volume isn't that loud, bass is also not that adequate, highs-mids-lows are also average, charging time is also much less than advertised,its a bit difficult to take the ear piece out of the case as it takes auto touch or might slip, connectivity is good, build quality is also good. Overall sound quality isn't up to the mark as expected from boat. Only buy if you don't use earphones that often and only want to try truly wireless earphones.",1.0 
50,Total waste,Though the airdopes are awesome but they work well for some time only after use of 6 to 7 months one side of the airdopes stopped working.

55,Simply worth a single penny in this range.," Thanks for coming to check my review, I purchased this product in Oct 2020 and now it's been a year and today's date is 28 Oct 2021 and yet it is working very smooth so I can't stop my self by writing this review, above photos and video is recorded just before putting this review, products sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality, battery backup is best than expectations. eardrops case is very small and light weighted so you can carry it anywhere and anytime in your pocket. it has long lasting battery backup so you can enjoy your journey in better way, according to my use (ie. 1 movie every day, game for almost half and hour, YouTube videos anytime, and some time songs) after fully charging my eardrops I can use it for almost 3 days without charging. Earbuds takes 15-20 min for charging in case and case takes almost 1 hour to get fully charged.Product look is very cute and stylish, also the silicon earplugs and  silicon side plugs (see the video) gives better support to fit it in ear.If you are planning to buy this product just don't think more, go and order it for you. Its really worth it to buy.",4.0 
56,Elegant and very sofisticated product with a cool look.,"Ordered it during sale, received it quickly enough. Pairing was easy, size of the charging case is nice and small. The magnets are strong to hold the buds in its place within case. Added bonus that charging case comes with usb C charging. Voice is decently clear for calls.Here is the problem, the left earbud has low hum/ringing noise. Like tr tr tr tr tr ..... when music is not playing.I figured it needed a factory reset, tried it. No change.Figured it could be external interference, tried it in open place and no change. It almost like they got quality control issue.Did a return and replace and new item is also same. I’m not sure if this is specific to black model or all models. I’ll be returning this and get something else.",5.0 
57,Audio Latency,So this was my first TWS purchase here are the pros & cons if you are thinking to buy it:Pros:-Pubg on the first day faced a negligible lag but after that is working completely fine.-Bass is super excellent.-Battery backup is also good & reliable.-Easy on hand experience.-Too smooth connectivity.-Very much comfortable in ear and will not fall in any circumstances.-While wearing handkerchief or a mask still other person is able to hear you completely on the call.-Calling is very smooth and effective.-Great touch technology used just read the guide to understand it properly.Cons:-Noise cancelation doesnot properly works while riding.-On the calls have to speak up a bit loud sometimes while in a crowd.Its a great purchase in this range in love with this one worth for such a low price.,2.0 
58,Overall a good package in this price point.,"It offers many impressive features and have an amazing look.... The case has been given smooth finish in addition to that, it provides a small pouch to keep the case..... It's overall appearance in one is stunning..... Now coming to the sound, audio products in india are tend to be stronger in bass, but the Boat Airdopes 441 perhaps takes this a bit too far.... Though it creats an ambience around you but the punch and aggression sometime is very fatiguing at all volumes..... The fittings of the earbuds are good, and it provides two sizes of the  rubber around it, so it accurately fits for all sizes of the ear. So if you are looking for a stylish, comfortable and secure fit airdopes which can provide a  magnificent sound with enough noise cancellation in around 2k-2.5k budget then you can definitely go for it.",5.0

60,Made in China market by Indian Brand Boat,"Now who can Say, when you are buying from a Company registered as Indian Company with such a legends associated with a brand are ultimately importing gadgets from China. 😀😠🥺😂 and marketing it here with Indian brand name..It is Cheating - it is not made in India but PRC means People Republic of China 😂😂😂👈I am not against the  product, it is Awesome - well designed, good quality and superior performance.❤️❤️❤️",4.0 
61,Good for a budget earphone,"Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.Cons: Brace yourself-Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone.",3.0

63,Boat airdopes sound total review,I bought it on a discounted price of 2499.The Quality of the product is Good and the battery life on full charge goes up to 12hours. It also depend on the volume you use.After using a week i found that it was nit pairing one fine day then i got manual and Reset the air drops and it started working fine.It feels premiumIf compared to other air pods boat is Better then others . I have given it 4 stars for less Bass quality.I used it today when it was raining and it is still working. I have a Bose soundsport. And the only difference i found was bass and bose has Little better noise cancellation. For price range of 2500 this is the best Airdops / air pods,4.0 
64,Bad Chinese procured product..All they put is the Boat logo..waste,"Don't buy this useless Chinese made earbuds. The right earbud stopped working within 1 month of use...used only during my jogs..they say it's IPX6 but doubt it...they just stamped their boat logo on some cheap Chinese made product which they procured in bulk ...Morever the connectivity during bluetooth calls is also intermittent..keeps on disconnecting on its own...Go for redmi, realme buds...UPDATE: Received my replacement product after 1 month (picked up on 25.7.20) today ie 30.8.20 but that too also has problem....Left bud not charging properly, even after 1 hr in the case, left bud only charges 20%....Also left bud getting overheated even with 5 minutes of usage and discharges thereafter....What kind of company you guys are running...dont even check the products before selling them..would that mean i again have to wait another month for the replacement..You just take back your product and refund me the money..",1.0 
65,Not expected from most awaited product.,"Received brand new product but one Airdope was stoped woking suddenly. After reading user manual, I came to know that, I need to put that airdope in charging case. Then only it will work properly. But it happens frequently. Also base quality is not that much good as expected. Hence returned this product. Thanks Amazon for refund my money as usual on time. (Which takes time from Flipkart.)",3.0 
66,Below Average Product,"When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499.",2.0 
67,Good Product,"COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.NOISE CANCELLATION:Don't have to worry about it wearing off easily 👍🏻. Noise cancellation is also great it blocks all the noise around you (fan, tv noises, etc...).BATTERY BACKUP:Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 8-10 days.MIC:My only concern is the mic, while on phone some people, on the other hand, have complained about my voice (too low and breaking) but it just may be because of my low volume speak, so anyone who have low pitch speaks you would have to speak a little louder.CAPACITIVE BUTTON:The touch buttons are too sensitive, so during a workout the song stop sometimes because of my shoulder or my shirt. Also during a call, if  I have to remove the ""AirDopes"" my hand would accidentally touch the capacitive button and the call gets disconnected (one solution to this is to first disconnect them from the phone first, then remove them).SOUND QUALITY:I have no complaints about the sound quality. The bass is PERFECT not too much (as seen earlier on older boat products, they fix it I guess).  The high and low are also clear.",5.0 
68,Great product at affordable price,"Awesome product. Bass is great. Sound quality is also very good. Cannot comment on the battery back up as i have received it just yesterday.

69,Pretty useful and awesome sound quality,This product is AMAZING!!!. you can feels the beats coursing through your veins listening to all time favourite bollywood evergreens is completely different experience . Try listening to 8d audio its so coollll . The charging is easy connectivity is also fast . Through one plus you can adjust the the bass etc type c charger is really fast . The packaging case is pretty useful and handy . Noise cancellation is on point if you listen to at 50 percent and above ( my mom was not happy w this) . Also i dance a lot and workout so its perfect for that once you fit it in you ear it doesn't fall off ( conducted my own test by dancing on uff teri ada)MUST BUYYYY!!!ILL UPDATE AFTER A MONTHTHANK YOU FOR READING THIS FAR,5.0 
70,Made in China now matters a lot,"I bought musili vv1 for 1999 prior to buying this. It's louder compared to this. But lacks in quality of sound. So i returned muzili vv1 and ordered this one. It's my 6th boat headset over the years and yes boat delivers quality.These airdopes are a bit of trouble if worn for over 45 mins. As many users have complained about and uneasy headache, I too faced it and had to remove it often. The headphones are not loud enough as one would expect them to be. So i tweaked my dolby atmos and max'd all the Equalizers to get the desired sound and yet it lacked somewhere. However the clarity, highs and lows and deep bass are great. It took roughly 3 hrs on full volume to deplete the battery to 50 %.Sadly It's made in china and I will be returning it",4.0

Some other people have also reported the same.Basically Airdopes 441 and 441 Pro are same, just case and IP7 rating is different.The Case is heavy almost 3/4 weight of a phone and is big, but with larger battery capacity.If you are Ok with 15-18 hours backup go with just 441 to save money.However this is also worth a buy.",5.0

Even I tried my best to connect bt it does not. But it connected with my laptop. I felt very bad about this coonectivity issue bcz I refered this model to my friends circle...and this is not first time, initially #boat product was good but later days in the sense after 2 or 3 months it's shows lots of issues...before purchasing boat product kindly think twice.",1.0 
74,Good grip n balanced Sound,"2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly. Though TV is right in front of me 3m away. Even Boat rocker headphone I use otherwise works better than this.These things are not being told or checked in youtube reviews availble strangely, either they are paid reviews or they don't check thoroughly.Ear grip is good, sound is reasonable but when I was watching BBT on prime video, sound was relatively low. So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue.",4.0 
75,Hopeless! 😣,"Product is very nice,  but one think is very poor, that is during the calling 2nd person can't hear clearly, they said sound are not perfect. They can't hear my words properly! The words are reaching them by echoing 😥",1.0 
76,Touch controls extra sensitive not useful when sleeping on the side,"These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 🌟 rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.",3.0 
77,Honestly a pretty decent stuff with the price tag,"I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2. Seamless stereo/mono switch - works fantastic every time. No issues faced3. Build is pretty good - for the price, the build quality is really good. The LED is fantastic i must say4. Touch - the touch is just, well, too good. It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn’t fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don’t hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them.I cannot comment on the battery or long term issues. I have used it for my runs and casual listening. For the price, this is really a decent bud pair!!",4.0 
78,Almost worth the price,"Pros:1) nice fit.2) bass is adequate.3) Sturdy buildCons:1) the auto-connect doesn’t worked for my device, ideally it should connect automatically to the last paired device.2) the charging time is quite high.3) the vocals and mids are not balanced, this device is more bass oriented.4) the loudness could have been slightly better.5) Missing Equaliser mode.6) touch is bit clumsy and delayed, response time should have been better.Verdict: the top 2 cons could be manufacturing defects, i have requested a replacement. This is a sturdy device in my understanding at the given price, but definitely there is big scope of Improvement.",2.0 
79,An honest review (2 days usage) (edited after 7 months),"Got them in prime day sale (blue colour)Using since past 2 days.Using themJust forget that it need to be charged also (both case and dopes). Just put buds in case while bathing etc or whenever you dont need them. Even after 15-20 mins they will again be ready for rock n roll.Music: nice sound, volume is enough and amplified, bass is boosted, after 80% volume bass is really thumping and overtakes other volumes.(If you are not a bass lover- just dont buy)Fit: originally fitted fins and buds were bigger than my ear and causing a but painI have changed to smaller buds and fins and after they fits better.Still NOT best fit, but alright.As they are on a bit tighter side in fit, there is just no chance that they fall off.They wont fall even if one is runningBut if you are using them for more that 3 hours straight, they causes pain in ears.Controls: nice crontrolsBut thing is they are very sensitive, means even on a call a slight adjustment just cuts the call.On call sound: just BADIf other person is on a good network with a good phone, they can hear you a bit clearly but everyone else, they just struggle to get your voice.Just not meant for callsMono use: both bids can be used separately for every single job, including calls also.If battery is a issue with you, just put one in case and use one, after a while start using other and put first one in case.Overall: nice purchase for 2500I also own boat rockerz 255 and rockerz sound is better than these airdopes.

They abruptly cut all the ties with me after that, they dont respond to my emails asking status,  no response on twitter, helpline not going through.  The ticket number is 1540334 and they didnt respond to me for the past 1 month. Stay away from any Boat product, rather than that go for some brand who will respond to you or buy a cheap one and toss it of when stops working.Update: oct 25th. Finally they sent a replacemet earbuds.  So changing the ratimg from 1 to 2.",5.0 
90,Buy it if you don't mind listening to static noise in your sound all the time.,"I bought these a few days back, and as soon as I paired it with my phone, I could hear a constant static noise from the left earbud. I thought it would go away after some time, unfortunately even after 1-2 days, it did not. I tried it with my OnePlus 5T, Windows laptop, iPad, all of them gave the sound on the left side. The right side worked without issue. So I thought it might be a faulty product and ordered a replacement, and when the replacement arrived, it still had the same issue. It is very annoying and highly noticeable at times like dialogues without any music/ scenes when there is not much audio in movies, especially at volumes anything lower than 25%. Above that, if it is boomy music, it gets masked and you can't hear it, but it is still there as I could hear it during silent parts.Apart from this issue, the bass on this is pretty unsatisfactory, although it might be okay as compared to some cheap wired earphones.Pairing is fast and works as advertised, and so does the battery.I found the noise really annoying and I ended up returning it.",2.0 
91,No bass and beats,Worst sound quality means the beats are low and this product doesn’t have good connectivity with the iPhone.

92,Buy if you want to waste money! Damn Serious,I bought this on the day of release i.e. on 6th August. Had to place a replacement due to disturbing noise in the left earbud. Got the replacement thereafter from Amazon. The new one also had the same issue but very feeble. Thought i could adjust so used it for couple of weeks. 24th August both the earbuds stopped working and now i have completed the return/replacement timeline. Post which i had to order a replacement under warranty online in BOAT website which will take 20 days to complete. I am still waiting for the replacement. Frankly a pain in the A**,1.0

This and other similar boAt products (Rockerz) are just poor pieces of tech which will remain in dumpyards and pollute our planet for years.These Airdopes actually feel like they're high on dope - sometimes they pair like a breeze, sometimes they don't. There are instances where the sound comes through only on one of the earpieces, whereas on other instances both work fine. The mic for capturing speech works at times, when it feels like. Otherwise, the other party doesn't hear you at all.I would rather save myself the hassle and spend a bit extra on a Sony/JBL which will actually work and last me for a while.As of now, I have two pieces of marble (the earpieces), one mini jewellery box (the charging case), all containing tech and batteries which need to be dumped in a landfill.

Good look for the price. Was very happy on the initial use of work call and music during work. Trouble started on day 2, when I used it for workout. Even a slight touch on the left pod starts iTunes. This was a big annoyance as I was listening to something off iTunes. Then tried connecting to my Android, but it wasn't pairing. On day 3, when I opened the case, the left pod wasnt charged and ran out of battery again soon. Returned it to get another box, which had left pod charging issues repeatedly. Ended up returning that too.",2.0 
106,One week into it and still Wow.,"Just delivered. Started using it. Not going into techno babble, I am going to record my initial observations:1. One day delivery by Amazon. Got it at Rs. 2499.2. Great packing by BoAt, looks neat and organized.3. A bit heavier case considering the extra juice stored in the battery to be used as a power bank in case of 'emergencies'.4. Instant battery level indicator on the case by pressing an associated button on the front of the case.5. Instant searching by the pods when I opened the case, denoted by blinking green light (looks cool).6. On pairing mode the ring of light alternates in green and blue light, the pairing is easy and hassle free.7. The sound after connecting is something I wouldn't say as balanced but on the bass heavy side, but Boat sure knows to make bass heavy earpieces.8. As happened with my earlier Boat wired earpieces, the default eartips/buds had to be replaced with the largest of the extra tips provided in the box and like my previous experience, the sound quality changed and became more balanced although it was still bass heavy and if one can corre tly set equalizer values, the sound may sound better. It is my personal viewpoint and observations.9. The touch may seem to be confusing as the number of tap one has to make and I found that I made more taps than what I should have reuired to do for changing to next track and thus was annoying. However, I believe to be adapted to it after more use. However, having said that, I felt that the after-tap response is a miniscule bit late thereby creating the confusion of tapping.10. There is no volume control option in the earpiece but I found a novel way to do so by pairing both these airdopes and Honor band 5 (with a music control update) with my mobile phone. It worked and still works like magic and guess it is more cool to do so by changing, pausing, controlling volume by a smart band rather than tapping on the airdopes.11. Tested call in outdoors and indoors- in home and in a moving car with other people present. In quieter environment the call is clearer. Having said that for both the cases, the call was quite good even if not HD quality. Still haven't used in a street call. Will update the call quality after another few days of usage.12. The ring of light across the touch area is a dope. I really liked it amd was one of the reason in buying this airdopes, but sadly, I found that they were not lighting up when the song plays and lights up only when certain functions happen. Green for charged condition and searching, Blue-green alternate for pairing and red when tapped on the earpiece. I don't know whether that feature can be turned off or not in these airdopes.13. The battery of the airdopes stood out to 50% after 3 hours of continuous music usage. The battery indicator light on the case has four dots and after 5 hours, 3 dots were visible, thus I conclude that there will be ample juice left for the whole day for a heavy usage.WILL UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER ONE WEEK USAGE.",5.0 
107,Good Buy,"At price of ₹2499/- this is the best earbuds, I'd say as this has touch sensor and good quality ear in speakers, it is light weight, but I've given 1star because- it has IPX6 and I brought it by watching advt stating IPX7, 1star for misleading information",1.0

110,Noida Service Center is running a Fraud,One the earbuds stopped working after few weeks. Went to Service Center to get it repaired/replaced. Got to know that the Service Center in Noida is running a fraud in which they ask me 500 rupees to replace the product which shouldn't be the case legally. And then made me wait a month to give me back the same faulty product that I gave them.Really disappointed in the Customer Support of Boat. Have mailed them but honestly would think twice before buying boat products in future. Heard from lots of Noida that they faced same fraud and boat is simply doing nothing to save their user base in the city.,1.0 
111,Overall good but the call quality is not good.,"These are some good truly wireless earphones in the market right now that don't burn a hole in your pockets. Fits snuggly in your ear ( but won't remain there for long if you do a rigorous exercise), good noise cancellation, great audio quality, reliable connection up to 6-8 metres and the flickering LEDs are some good points I can think right now. The battery life is good and lasts about 3-4 hours on a single charge. The total times the buds can be charged from the case is good too and practically you won't be able to keep track on the count. It will last easily for weeks. The power bank functionality of the case comes in handy. That's a good feature.So far good. The call quality over the Bluetooth is pretty bad. Yes, bad. Most of the time you won't be able to hear the other person and he wouldn't be able to hear you completely. These buds as headsets perform really poor. So not recommended for that purpose. The buds otherwise are great. Go for it!",4.0 
112,AMAZING PRODUCT - Exceed the expectations!!!,"Even though Iam a regular buyer through Amazon, I very rarely use to write review. Use to post only if iam very much satisfied with the product or just the oppt. This product.. I must write it. Amazing product.. really awsome. It exceed the expectations. You all know that now a days earbuds are available from the starting price range of 1800 to 30000 around. For this boat airpodes it cost 2400/-. So I was expecting just average sound quality and features. But it just brow me away with its punching bass and features. It mentioned only 6mm driver unit in it. It really makes me wonder how a 6mm driver can give such an amazing sound quality with literary ear drum vibrating bass effect. Oh God. Totally unexpected. Thanks Boat giving such amazing product in such an affordable price range. This boat company is winning the trust and love of many customers.

It is just wonderful.I can run on the treadmill with the Airdopes in my ears, I can jump around and it won't fall off.Process of connecting is also seamless; auto-connect feature works perfectly (Oneplus 6T)For online classes/meetings: Microphone is just alright.

I personally feel it. I think the noise cancellation feature is just to write in product description this does not actually work.if you are a music lover then it's for you only but again if it does not fulfill the calling feature then why should we waste so much money?

I immediately took it out and to my surprise it didn't stop workingCons:1) If not put properly, your ear will start aching after few minutes2) Touch button for calling/disconnect so if you adjust the ear pod in the middle of a call, more often than not it will disconnect the call3) There is a slight lag in reaction time which is not a deal breaker as you get used to it.",2.0

121,Bass is OVERRATED!,"If you are looking for true bass, then I would not recommend this. While it is good and high on music, it isn't as thumping as mentioned. One of the buds not working is a common problem and restarting/rebooting is the only option to fix it. Fixes perfectly with the ear and ears don't pain even after couple of hours of usage. It does work for 3.5 hours non-stop. No issues with calling.Biggest Drawback: They work pathetically bad with laptops. Right from connectivity to touch sensors to music shuffling (especially on YouTube, everything lags at regular intervals. Bottom line is they are just not made for laptops but if you still want to use it then be prepared to use your hands on keyboard and delayed sound.",2.0

It's happening with YouTube, Spotify, Gaana, and every other app.Then I replaced this and got today dated 28 Aug but it even worse.

Connection is fast, open the case and it connects to the last device before you even reach out to pick them up. Sound is good if correct ear buds are used.

Bluetooth of the ear buds not identified for pairing... basically overall used and defective product sent to me.Am returning this... hopefully a better review with the replacement ear buds.2 months later review - got the replacement. Sealed and box packed. Within 2 months started facing intermittent issues... abruptly one ear buds would switch off or both shut down within 20 mins of using, even though fully charged.

131,Battery is less than 50 minutes,"6-Jul-2021: Quality is okay and as per the price paid so no complaint. But battery is awful. You cannot have 1 hour call on this. During office call, I noticed left bud is out at 45min. Switched to speakerphone on mobile. It happened in another call too. Each time Battery was fully charged before the call and battery is out at 45-50 min with left bud. Boat is marketing battery for 5 hour. That is either flat out lie or poor quality control.Also why rating for this product is so high? Yes rating at Amazon can be manipulated but there seems too many positive rating with this earbud. Maybe I am just unlucky. Will try the replacement.7-Jul-2021: battery time of replacement is 2.5 hour only. One more issue, if you touch your ear during call, call will switch out of bluetooth, you need to select bluetooth options again in call. Same issue with WhatsApp, MS Teams or Zoom call. Poor usability design. On this product return doesn't exist so have to keep it. Not happy for wasting over 2K on this.",1.0

133,Not worth it - review after a year of usage,"I bought the neon yellow pair last year in the Amazon Diwali sale. After reading reviews, I decided on the AirDopes Pro because of the extra battery life. I primarily wanted to use them for the gym, for HIIT and heavy cardio and also for watching videos and movies on my phone.I am writing this after almost a year of using them. Overall, I am very disappointed with the defects in the product that have developed over a year and poor customer service.ISSUESBattery Life - AS LISTED, works for way more than the time listed. The case once charged lasted me for around 3-4 weeks, based on a minimum usage of 1-2 hours daily, some days even 4-5 hours.Comfort - they are a comfortable fit, no headaches or any pain in the ear after a year of using them.Touch controls - touch is tricky; in my right bud, the touch works sometimes and sometimes not. Sometimes the bud will turn off without any touch and at other times, repeated touch with the flashing light won't make it change the song. So this aspect is difficult to judge.Sound quality - I listen to EDM in the gym and slow music at other times. Bass is non-existent. the sound quality is nothing to brag about, it is pretty much neutral but that is not why you bought this so do not expect that from these buds.Working - you can use one bud at a time, and leave the other one in the case to charge (to prolong battery life if you are running low or if you only want to listen from one ear). but you will loose the touch controls of whichever bud you are not using (right - track forward, left - track reverse; can be switched off with either).Call - you CANNOT TAKE A CALL on these. they do not work for that, do not buy if you WFH and need these for a call, you will be disappointed and you cannot return them.OTHER CONS- when i got these, there was some background noise in the left bud which would not go away. even after activating my warranty, the company (amazon and boat both) refused to exchange or return these. after some time, the noise went away but i was disappointed at the absence of help through amazon, whose customer service is really good at other times. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE, AND THEY WONT LET YOU EXCHANGE THEM EITHER. the left bud noise issue is present with other reviewers also (I checked later) and remains unsolved and random.- I lost one of my buds two months ago, and there is no way to find it back. No separate application is available for this so just be careful.- the sound quality of my right bud has deteriorated over the past few months (since June, around 10 months after i bought these), and the sound is now so low that I cannot even hear them properly. I regularly clean it and the case, and charge it on time but this issue has not gone away. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE DETIRIORATION OF SOUND QUALITY IN A LESS THAN A YEAR. My brother got the same set in a different colour, and BOTH HIS BUDS have experienced the same sound quality deterioration so this issue is not just limited to my buds.OVERALL - if you can afford a better set of buds, save your money and buy that. There is no point in spending around 3-4k on this only to do that again next year. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",2.0 
134,Poor product and brand experience,"The earphones are not designed well enough to sit comfortably in the ear. The buds go in and are not problematic, but the body is not shaped to be a comfortable fit in the ear. It hurt a lot to keep the pods in for more than 15 minutes. I even changed the tips to solve the issue, but they kept falling out. Also the touch feature is overly sensitive and easily recognizes false touch. An accidental brush while pushing my hair out of my face also caused it to disconnect, when according to the user manual, it should require three taps to disconnect. While on call, the earphones constantly glitched out and sent distorted noises to the person I was talking to (I was sitting in a quiet environment, so there's no question of BG noise)I'm aware these pods don't feature noise cancellation, but they do glitch a lot. I also had issues with delayed bluetooth pairing. Maybe I received a faulty pair, but in three days I was fed up with the earphones and chose to return them. I'm not someone who buys without research, and this product was advertised to fit my needs. Unfortunately, it did not function to my expectations. I have been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've had to return a product because I was so throughly dissatisfied with it.The airdopes could improve by providing a larger variety of tips and a better shape to fit in the ears. I really liked the Boat Rockerzz I had bought last year so wanted to try Boat again, however this purchase is making me question the brand.",2.0 
135,I wish there was a return option.,"Very poor quality product -1. While using for calls, you sound very hollow to the person in the other side. I’ve been told I sounded like I was in a tunnel !2. Sound quality is poor - too much treble and that is hard on your ears when conversations are dominant - that’s normally the case with calls.3. The touch system is total BS - if you touch to adjust position during a call , the call gets cut. If you decide to take it off since it doesn’t work well, the call gets cut. The touch is ultra sensitive and you can’t bring your fingers close to the buds without doing something unintended. Horrible design- far from consumer centric.Otherwise, it is fine - pairs easily. Holds charge (esp since it is sparingly used ).",1.0

The left earphone was sounding weaker than the right one, I checked all settings and even changed devices to understand if I'm doing something wrong, but it still was the same3.

Now the case would loose it's own charge within a day in just 3 hours of total usage!I have sent the airdopes back for warranty, but haven't heard back on any status updates.

Phone gets connected very often as you try to adjust the headphone in ears while putting it on.Also, very often only one side ear phone gets connected and its a struggle to connect the otherone.Overall, NOT worth the money they charge for it.

138,It's nice while using and comfortable wearing whether you're in gym or out. Not good for talking,"I'm giving this review after using this Airdopes for 6months. It's nice while using and comfortable wearing whether you're in gym or out.Not good for talking you can't talk over the phone while using this Boat Airdopes 441 pro , person won't be able to hear your voice properly with it. So not good for talking.But after 6 months it stopped working even not connecting to my phone as it used to get connected. So I raised complaint to claim warranty but  Boat provides pathetic services I could say😡, first Boat customer care doesn't reply to your call and mails, I had to do a lot to connect with them. After that they provided me too far service centre's addresses to visit to claim my warranty. Somehow I myself searched nearest Boat service centre and went their they asked me to submit my Airdopes with the problems I mentioned. Boat Team told me that I'll get replacement of this Airdopes under their policy, which will be couriered to me shortly.But after couple of days they sent me the same Airdopes with the problems I was facing at my address. Which is highly disappointing!!I again mailed them about this incident and it took almost about one month just to get the warranty claim after my continuous efforts otherwise Boat would not have given me the warranty.My question is why Boat doesn't provide smooth services and if Boat has one year warranty for their headphones you're supposed to give customers hassle free and good services because it's not our fault that your Airdopes doesn't work after 3-4 months of uses or stops working😡",3.0 
139,Waste of money or IS IT?,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.""This porridge is too hot!"" she exclaimed.So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.""This porridge is too cold,"" she said.So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.""Ahhh, this porridge is just right,"" she said happily and she ate it all up.After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest.""This chair is too big!"" she exclaimed.So she sat in the second chair.""This chair is too big, too!"" she whined.So she tried the last and smallest chair.""Ahhh, this chair is just right,"" she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces!Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep.As she was sleeping, the three bears came home.""Someone's been eating my porridge,"" growled the Papa bear.""Someone's been eating my porridge,"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!"" cried the Baby bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair,"" growled the Papa bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair,"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pieces,"" cried the Baby bear.They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled,""Someone's been sleeping in my bed.”""Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!"" exclaimed the Baby bear.Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, ""Help!"" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stairs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears.THE ENDThanks for reading the story. BTW product is awesome.",5.0 
140,Big punch in a (relatively) small package!,"So, I had tempered my expectations from this pair of earbuds mainly due to the price. There are just so many products populating this price-range that it's kinda overwhelming. Having said that, if music-quality is the main metric for you, these earbuds just might be it.PROS:- Excellent bass, as advertised. I played a lot of songs with different bass types to test out what these earbuds could do- and they were fantastic!- The bass is punch yet well-defined. There's little to no distortion or sludginess in the low-end.- It'll make you happy if you like either the thumpy bass of hip-hop or the groovy bass-lines in classic rock or funk.- The mids are strong and vibrant for a pair of relatively inexpensive earbuds.- The earbuds themselves look great and feel well designed.- The build quality of the buds is pretty good-quality plastic.CONS:- The case doesn't seem to be very well constructed. The lid is especially a bit wobbly. You'll have to take care no to bump or drop the case.- Also, the case is fairly devoid of any features that are offered in other products in this price range- like, battery level indicators.- Highs are okay. There's no tinny feeling in the highs, but they aren't great.OVERALL:These are great earbuds for the price if you like the thought of having truly wireless buds but don't want to shell out the exorbitant prices from the well-known brands like JBL, Senheiser, etc.",5.0 
141,Liked but has many drawbacks,Seems Nice on look it's Red Colour I bought Colour is on darkest tone side not on brightest as shown on reference pic and that's Good. When I used continuously it did last for 2.5 hrs or 2 hrs . Left earbud for nearby 3 hrs on 70 percent volume. Sound is good bass can be controlled if you have any bass booster app installed. I bought the earbud thinking it would last for 3 hrs or more than it as described on advertisement the Pro version has 5 hrs but it's a big drawback . We can charge it again but powerbank doesn't have enough power to last more than 2 days ( i used for listening music for 3 times a day in that) . Also on listening on one earbud you have to pair the both earbud to mobile you can't pair one earbud. Mistake can be seen I used one earbud after charge down . Try to use another don't know why it wasn't paired then I again put in box and after opening box try pairing it paired. Also the range of Bluetooth is 3 to 5 metres only.You can't return back only replacement option is there that's too bad. Anyway it's still good. But if you have a budget of nearby 4000 recommend to prefer jbl even if it is button version not touch. You can buy if it's below 3000,3.0

Buying boat products is penny wise pound foolish, as inorder to save some bucs people end up buying low quality earphone like boat. They are nit only cheap quality but also the fit is terrible.

144,Amazing product by boAt!!,The best wireless buds out in this proce range. Got it for 2.5k rs and it is worth every penny. The bass is just terrific!! Highs mids and lows are just in place.Just a little issue of the synch time lag of maybe 0.5 sec.The mobile touch clicks can be heard only after that tiny time lag. Everything else is just top notch at this price.Stays in the ear even if we try to bounce it off the ear.  Best option for workouts and cardio sessions.Loved it. Amazing product by boAt.,5.0 
145,"Not good, not worth 2499.","When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2499 and within days - now it s priced at 1799.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.After using it for 2 months left ear bud stopped working so I had complained on there website after which they replaced it but in the 2nd set that they sent the same issue arised after a month now they are not even accepting the complaint even though it is in warranty period.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 999.",1.0 
146,"If you're searching for a mid range model with premium features, go for it!","Alright, I have been using this product for a month now and I have to say the buy was worth it.• Boat lived up to its name and delivered a marvellous sound quality: (4/5). To give you a better idea, let me give you an example: I am able to hear the harmonics and adlibs of every song I listen to just as clearly as the main vocals. It's thAt clear.• As for the bass: (3.5/5), yup, it's good, although if you're someone who listens to metal music would not find it satisfactory. Other than than, the bass is awesome for the other music genres.• Noise cancellation: (3/5), I'm not saying it'll shut you off from the world BUT I'm also nOt saying Airdopes' noise cancellation will be unable to filter the background disturbances. It can. And it does it well. I was satisfied with the NC'n for a product bought at this price range.• The touch controls work wonderfully. They're easy to understand. To be able to control your media with touch rather than having to search for and push buttons happened to be a primitive job well designed and I am hence very happy with the easy controls.Overall this product is very satisfactory for this price. While you can't expect to have the quality of a premium model such as Bose, you sure can expect it to be the toughest competition in the mid range models.My only complaint with Airdopes is that I can't alter the volume as there is simply no option for it. But given that I most have my phone in my pocket I don't think this little problem is not much to not buy this product.So if you're thinking of buying it, go for it.",5.0

Design and the whole unit's look and feel is awesome - despite it is mentioned as china made... hope my next buy of this bluetooth device will be out of ATMANIRBHAR2. I extensively use it under wifi and also under jio data, and it has been performing so well3. As an avid marathoner, I wanted to check its USER VALUE by means of (1) comfort wearing on ears, (2) audio quality and noise cancellations as I will be running out on road with traffic noises do affect this aspect (3) BATTERY LIFE, (4) MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS NOT FALLING OFF FROM EARS DUE TO JERK IN MY RUNNING MOVEMENTS AND (5) FINALLY, its durability to fight sweat on ears and also in rain conditions, as I ran within my building in the last three days in rain wearing it JUST TO CHECK ITS IXP7 CERTIFICATION THEY ADVERTISED ON THIS PRODUCT.... IT HAS PASSED ALL MY TESTS4. Hence, it is worth buying THOUGH THE PRICE could definitely be just around Rs.2000 and not above... Amazon should think on this factor as well as BoAt as well.",5.0

Noise cancellation is top quality.You may experience some pain in your ears during initial days but that'll go away with regular usage.

150,"Good consumer grade earphones, punchy bass, superior fit","For the price, these earphones make a great choice for anybody on the market for TWS. I've known boat for pretty good sound quality (consumer grade) and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well. The battery backup is decent, and these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever. The fit is amazing, and they just don't come off no matter how much I try to shake them off.Definitely would recommend this in the given price range",5.0 
151,"Amazing Product. Well made, especially for sports wear and gaming as well.","I ordered a pair of Airdopes in blue colour to match my phone and laptop and they arrived in a proper sealed package and in less than 24 hours at my doorstep. It comes with an instruction manual on how the touch feature works etc. The quality of sound is pretty good as well and I mostly got it for my gymming and gaming so that I do not have to worry about any wires. It's also useful for people who are listening to audio books or college lectures so that they can keep the phone at a distance and do their work by listening side by side. The waterproof feature means your sweat or rain will not affect the sound quality which is useful esp for sports purposes. The light up feature is great for locating the Airdopes in the dark which was useful for my gaming. And I'm able to listen wireless with hands free convinience. The range of the bluetooth connection is really good too! It also came with a charging case and a USB cable for charging. This product is probably the best purchase I have made so far and I'm really happy with it!.Few ways the product can be improved: Many a times when I pair it to a different device, only one of the earplugs work. And the other one doesnt. So I have to put it back into the charger again and then again take it out. I would suggest that there should be a button only for mono mode to prevent it from randomly connecting to only one earplug. But thats just a suggestion I have. Also the USB cord is really small. I think it should be a little bit longer, but I can connect my type C phone cord too it as well. Rest I am happy with my purchase. Thank you :]",5.0

153,boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds with IWP Technology,"Choosing boAt Airdopes 441 over another brand came down to affordability, and durability. Sure there are much more expensive, and cheaper earbuds, but being spoilt for choice, the boAt Airdopes 441 met my needs. Many prospective buyers who are curious about the origins of the boAt brand? The boAt Airdopes is an Indian consumer electronics brand company who manufacture a fantastic product. For some readers, this review could be long, please bear with me.The reason I bought these earbuds was primarily for hands-free phone conversations with family and friends - giving me the freedom to move away from the handset. The distance of 10 meters mentioned on the instruction manual should be sufficient for most users, provided there are no physical barriers such as walls, doors, and other interference between the Bluetooth signal and the handset. For me, the boat 441 earbuds performed well up to a distance of about 6 meters. But, because of walls between the earbuds and the handset, the calls dropped, and then reconnected once I moved closer to the handset. Without obstructions, the Bluetooth signal should travel the distance of 10 meters comfortably as mentioned in the instruction manual.The instructions in the manual are straightforward and easy to follow. The boAt Airdopes 441 can be used individually, or together for TWS (True Wireless Stereo) listening - perfect for my needs. And besides, if the need arose the earbuds can be factory reset due to malfunctioning, not paring with the handset, or in general, problems with connectivity. The 70-hour (2 hours short of 3 days), standby for the earbuds when in its cradle lets you take it with you when on the move – excellent.What about sound? Well, the 6mm drivers on the earbuds are excellent. There’s lot of bass for bass-heads out there. Considering, prior to buying the earbuds, I rarely listened to music on the handset; now the earbuds are getting a workout. A word of advice - the sound quality could get addictive.The short charging time is excellent for the casual user like myself. I did drain the charging case unknowingly, and when I plugged the case back in, I noticed a mauve / red circle around the blue pulsating light to inform me the charging case is completely, or close to being drained of its charge. Once it begins to charge, the mauve / red circle disappears, while the blue light continues to pulsate. And when the case and the earbuds are fully charged, the pulsating blue light returns to a steady blue. The only downside to the charging experience was the rather short charging cord.The other nice attribute about the boAt 441 Airdopes are they connect using IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) technology with your handset. That’s after the earbuds have been paired with the handset. The touch controls are sensitive to either end, or begin a call, or music track. The one option the earbuds don’t have is volume control; it’s got to be done on the handset.I’ve had the boAt 441 Airdopes now for over a month, had a couple of hiccups, which were eventually ironed out. With proper care and handling, hope to get descent miles in the coming years. Incidentally, if you don’t hear any sound in your earbuds? Check if they are paired correctly with the handset, and powered up – fully charged.Lastly, the boAt 441 Airdopes is an excellent pair of earbuds, which deserves 5 stars!Hope this review was helpful.",5.0 
154,The real beast.... Without a doubt !!,"Yes u have done it yet again boat... Honest 1st day review.... To start with Delivery it was a bit late may b cuz of the current scenario... Bt to tell u guys these airdopes are the real beast in all the departments. Talking about the sound quality it is really nice, one can compare its sound quality with the good wired earphones available in the market, awesome punchy bass.. Vocals and treble were also quide good.  Built quality is way far better as compare to any other eatbuds in this price bracket but one thing the charging case is a bit slippery so be careful guys. Talking abt the battery backup guys i have not streached it for long as have used the airdopes for an hr or so and battery only droped 20% from 100 to 80 ( of airdopes not the charging case) , so in terms of battery i assume that i will give me decent battery backup of 3 to 4 hrs with approx 3 to 4 charging cycles of a fully charged charging case. I am just loving it :)Just go for it without a second thought !",5.0

Good for calling8. Connectivity good till 15m or so .....even if u have a wall in between.9. Excellent battery backup. I used it for 3.5h straight with one charge.10. Amazing fit and design.Specially for ppl with small ears....like me!Cons:1. Volume is not very high2. Touch pad is overly sensitive make it's use irritating sometimes3. I use spotify for music. Even If i close spotify app in my phone properly...accidental touch on the airdopes starts the music again. You will have to close the bluetooth itself to avoid that from happening. It becomes quite irritating at times. Now if u switch off bluetooth again and again....then you might have to pair the airdopes again too since one of the airdopes looses connectivity.4. While calling u will experience a disturbance on and off.....u might have to disconnect and connect again to avoid that.Overall it is a very good buy if u get it for around 2k,4.0

Horrible sound quality, I could not believe 2.5k worth gear will sound so horrible, so exchanged it for new one. Again sound remained same. If your goal is to look nice by wearing these, then definitely you should buy this.If you are looking decent sound quality stay miles away from it. All those reviews on YouTube and amazon they may not what is better sounding headphone. JBL, Marshall are benchmark at this price range. It will be grave sin on my part to compare this headphone with that of JBL / Marshall. 300rs Philips neckband headphone sounds  way better than this (Philips neckband headphone is extremely good at that price)",1.0 
164,Good budget earphones.,"Pros:1. At this price point, its much better than the competition.2. The only ear buds with a small silicone/rubber wing. It helps in keeping the bud in place even during work outs. The only time it pops out is if you bend down.3. The fit and finish of the buds and the storage case is decent. Size+ weight of the buds is perfect. The box is also small enough to be carried in your pocket.4. Very bass heavy sound stage. For most indian users, this will be a good thing.Cons:1. IWP sometimes fails. Just pop ear buds back in box and close. Open and try again.2. Touch control on the buds also sometimes fails. But again a simple reset solves the problem. (Ive noticed the failure only when my phone is connected to my amazfit watch also. And my watch also has music control, i suspect that could be the reason).3. The noise cancellation is purely by virtue of the snug fit of the ear buds. Similar to a passive noise cancellation.4. The microphone is decent, but picks up a lot of ambient noise. So a call in a public place will be a problem for the person you talk to.(multiple callers i spoke to mentioned too much background voices etc).5. Finally the sound stage/profile being too bass centric. Most songs can get by, but sometimes the bass just over powers everything else. Some tweaking of the equaliser may help.Verdict: would recommmend it for casual music listening. And for people who need music while they exercise. At this price point, im happy with my purchase.",4.0 
165,Do not buy,This product is not worth a penny. I have been using it and it is not good in any aspect. I have purchased a 50 rs wired earphones and they work better than this. In the name of noise cancellation it will cancel your own voice but it will definitely amplify your background noise. The person who you are calling won't be able to hear u clearly. You'll end up holding one earbud near your mouth for them to be able to hear you.Now talking about music. Literally every other earbud will give you same voice. Don't fall for thumping bass marketing. Invest your money somewhere else.Also one more thing to note. It really slips from ears fast.,1.0

167,Simple review of the product: Great,"If you are a bass lover then go  for it, bass is not overwhelming but punchy and maintain highs and mids properly with bass on higher side and thats how I like it.Noise cancellation is superb but this great ability restricts you from wearing them while walking on roads.Looks great, fit is a subjective isssue which can be adjusted and one you get the best fit you will make the most out of this TWS.Battery is one of the most impressing things of this device which lasts around 1 week if you are using it for 4 hours a day. Boat airdopes 441 pro is not worth as that one is quite bulky and too much of battery backup is just of no use as this one is providing more than enough.Charging case is sturdy feels premium in hands and small enough to be unnoticable when you carry the aroundCall experince was nice good when environment is quiet but in noisy conditions it works just fine for other side to be able to hear but can hear the noises too.There is absolutely no connectivity issue with them and comes with touch control with very good response and gestures provided on them.You can get them around ₹2000 in any electronics sale which make it worth for money 💰.If you have a budget around 2k then these are best for you. If there is any reason I will not recommended them is if you have better budget or you want superior call quality.Rest if you are looking to have a complete tws with spending less and saving more there is no reason you should spend more.",5.0

169,best buy,"Good product  . Bought it on sale , the cost was around 1999 . First thing I noticed was the weight , it was totally weightless . Second was the sound quality , it was better than what I had expected for a sub 2k earphones . Third was the ease of use , was very easy to pair and use  . The touch sensitivity is excellent  and can be worn even when for my morning run  . The best aspect is the battery life . Worth every paisa",5.0 
170,Touch too sensitive but still worth it!,"It is really a great product I got it for ₹1999 on sale. The bass effect is amazing and battery back up is just superb.Cons :Main drawback  is the touch is very sensitive so even a slight touch of your hand while adjusting the bud in your ear would cause the music to stop.CAN’T  use this while you are sleeping or laying side ways on your pillow - if you are person who listens to music while you sleep then you are in for a nightmare . You simply can’t use this as the touch to the pillow just turns off your earphones.Touch doesn’t just work with your hands it works with any dress material , gloves , pillows .... you name any surface it will be able to operate your earphones",5.0 
171,Definately check out this if you want a TWS in under 2k,"I have been using this from last 3 months and here is my opinion:Pros-1. Fits perfectly in ears with or without the ear hook.2. Bass quality is very good as per my experience.3. Boat claims 25 hours of total playback and yes they are right because I got a battery backup of total 22 to 23 hours with the case at average or medium volume and almost 17 to 18 hours of total backup at full volume.4. I found the noise cancelation very good especially in this price range.5. You get 2 years warranty with the product which no other company provides you in this price range.6. Easy to hold the case in hand, very sleek design.Cons-1. If you are using it for long sessions with or without the ear hook your ears may start paining because i have experienced it as they pain very much if you remove them after 2 or 3 hrs using.2. Plastic body case which might disappoint you.Overall a good product specially in 2k with good audio quality, bass, noise cancelation, fitting, etc. If you want a TWS in this price range from a trust worthy brand go for it.👍",5.0 
172,On an average/ a Good Product,"boAt Airdopes 441 comes with the latest Bluetooth v5 and gives you a truly wireless experience.It is equipped with IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) Technology that powers on the earbuds and puts them into connection mode as soon as one opens the lid of the carry case.Each earbud offers up to 5 hours of sound in a single chargeAlso, the charging case provides an additional 25 hours of playback audio.airdopes 441 has 6mm Drivers for fascinating audio bliss with HD sound.IPX6 rated protection against water and sweat to provide a carefree listening experience.The stereo calling feature makes your calling experience clear and smooth.boAt airdopes 441 offers one-tap instant voice assistant  to control and access the earbudsIt is specially designed to meet the needs of every music lover and offers extraordinary style with sports-centric, secure-fit ear hooks; although it might feel itchy from time to time. Should make a note of that BEFORE YOUR DECIDE TO BUY!",3.0 
173,Almost a perfect pair of Tws,"Pros:-Brilliant packaging-Damn impressive Led lights on Earbuds making them very attractive-Flawless connectivity with no apparent master-servant earbud visibility, therefore I can easily use one earbud at a time without losing connectivity.-Decent bass, nothing too overpowering.Cons-unlike old boat earphones I have (wired 225) these didn't have two sets of earbuds, which is all the more important because tws have special kind of buds which are hard to find. Plus, unlike them, this did not have a resealable packet, therefore once you open it, you gotta keep it somewhere else.- horrible lag for a bluetooth 5 earphone. Almost 1+ second lag. Moreover, it has a visible .5 second delay sometimes even for movies on netflix which generally sync the audio delay on bluetooth devices to make up for delayed lag. I'm not sure why it's there but it is.- though we all knew the calling wouldn't be clear in a tws, I tried using one piece near my mouth for easier clarity, but the super sensitive taps end up cutting the call instead, I wish we had an option to disable one tap cutting call on tws.- person issue- i find the connecting sound to be rather spookyDespite the nitpicking cons, I really like it. Though these aren't for gaming or calls, and definitely not to be worn while wearing a mask supported behind ear, because it'll hurt a lit otherwise.",4.0 
174,Honestly it is over hyped,"I had boat rockerz 510 ON EAR headphones & that gave me the impression that these particular Boat Airdope 441 may be  good but Honestly it doesnt. First, the airdope's Ear bud are kind of circular Cone shaped & that itself pushes out the Airdope away from ear & hence falls out easily! Second the Boat Earfins ie on side a small projected guard kind to prevent from fallout, that also doesnt seem to serve purpose! Inside 2 Airfins- Long Airfin, SHort Airfin provided. The problem is Long Airfin is a pain on the ears, neither provided grip & then short Airfin is kind of too small & dont serve either. PERHAPS THE DESIGN IS NOT MADE FOR ALL EARS, IN MY CASE IF I DO A LITTLE BIT OF JUMPING OR EXERCISE THE AIRDOPES FELL OUT EASILY SO WHATS THE USE?? Secondly The SOUND QUALITY is below Average, The BASE is OVER AMPLIFIED and the TREBBLE/Voices are not crystal clear enough and in High Volume you will only hear BASE and voice in music will be negligible. So it didnt leave upto the expectation. And Voice call is mostly unheard on the otherside. I would say the product is or may be good for NEW CUSTOMERS who just recently bought a wireless piece for the First Time but its not good for Experience customers like those who had Boat Rockers 510 as these 510 has awesome bass and awesome voice clarity in music, only downfall is bulky & not fit for voice call",2.0 
175,Beastdopes!!,"I purchased these airdopes in October 2020....I don't usually review any purchased items. But these airdopes are like Gopi bahu(and Aquaman)....no matter how bad they've been treated...they work just fine.So I am here.. writing a review after 7 months. Although I like earphones from the time of purchase itself,the connectivity, 8d kind of audio quality, etcBut recently I mistakenly dropped one of the airdope(Aquaman) in water and it stayed there immersed for 3 days .....on the fourth day when I found it .....I was sure it wouldn't work ...but by the time I splashed water on in....the LED started blinking red🙂......i thought to myself....that it's just the LED.....then it got connected with my phone..flawlessly....played music... flawlessly.....I was amazed. Only recently I found that the speaker is not working while I am on a call. I am totally fine with it.Now comes the miraculous escape of the other airdope....I ""accidentally""( I am very careful most of the times 🙂).....put the other airdope on top of the mixer grinder....the place where the jar fixes with the body(who does that?... I did)....and my equally carefully mom carefully fixed the jar with airdope beneath it. Next comes the sound of stones being ground.....but the jar had peanuts inside....that is when it hit me.I rushed and removed the jar. There it was.... innocently blinking red at me...I saw Gopi vaww in that moment. This time too I was sure that It wouldn't work , so I threw it in a shelf. But...you guessed it right....after 4 days today...when I finally freed myself from the claws of idling...I tried pairing it and IT IS WORKING TOTALLY FINE, without any issues whatsoever. Seriously, why?? Why tolerate so much?Hope my short review would pursuade you enough that you start dreaming about it....until you finally decide to buy it.",5.0 
176,Sound bass noise cancellation battery poor,boAt Airdopes 441 has no good noise cancellation difficult to hear from other side. Bass level is poor.

Then again this product is horrible.

178,Airdopes review,"Hey there!So, I just received my pair of Boat Airdopes 441 and as you can see in the pictures, it is in yellow and it's perfectly splendid! 😁I like the design a lot. The fit is snug and comfortable to my ears (two pairs of extra eartips are provided, so use what fits you). The average size tips fit me well and the fins help to secure it in your ears. It doesn't fall off even when working out. I need to check it with jump rope though.The bass is punchy and the various sounds are clear to my ears at medium volume.There is a kind of passive noise cancellation due to the in-ear design and it works a bit.Don't know about the battery life. Later, I might give an edit to this section after using it.The only thing I found a bit odd was that whenever I press pause/play, the music does not stop instantly. It takes about a second to stop.The packaging by Amazon was good.I got it for a mere ₹1600 and a tws at this price point, it's a steal!I suggest that you go for it! 👍Cheers!",4.0 
179,"Can't attend meetings with them, they keep on connecting and disconnecting.","Sound quality is good but the feature of noise cancellation works in wrong way. I used it with all types of software, Zoom, GoogleMeet, etc. The noise cancellation features auto disconnects and connects earphones all the time. I cannot connect my earphones when I am in meeting, it just sucks. Tried to search on google and I have applied almost all the workaround by updating zoom, updating Google Meet, checking on option of dont want noise cancellation everything. The problem is with earphones, they keep on connecting and disconnecting again and again.Use it only if you want to listen to music. If you want to join meetings then this product is not worth it.",1.0 
180,Better options available in this price range in October 2020,"After a lot of brain storming, I decided to go with Boat Airdopes 441. At this time, Xiaomi had already launched it's ear buds in 1799 but I still went ahead with Boat Airdopes because I loved the looks and I trust the bass from Boat.Looks - Trendy looking. The additional colorful bands that come up with it adds to the the looks.Sound - It has decent sound and good bassBattery Back up - It easily gives you around 4 hours though the company claims 5 hours. With the charging case, the battery back up doubles up easily.Comfort - I didn't find these buds too comfortable and after using it for 2-3 hours, my ears started hurting. I have to So even after all the decent features, this point alone brings the rating down to 3/5.Summary: Great earbuds but look out for other options in the price range 3000-3500",4.0 
181,Great product,"Its a good product, my piece has a little static that is noticeable when nothing is playing, but when the music starts to play the bass takes over and you realize how well made these small piece of earphones are. They are pretty cheap and really worth the money, the battery life could be better but the case makes up for it. The bass is good the treble is a little too much at high volumes but these aren't bose headsets so don't expect studio level sound quality from them.  If you are looking for eveyday headsets that are wireless go for them you can't go wrong with boat. Made in china tho, if that is an issue for you then think is over, but to make you feel better i can only say that they definately don't feel like a made in china product.",5.0 
182,Fantastic Product,"Amazing product. Worth buying. I already had wireless neck band. Still purchased this product. Very happy to have it. Connectivity is the best. Connects quickly without any disturbance on calls.Very comfortable and convenient. You can use one pod at a time while on calls (increases standby time of other pod). Also, it charges on its own. Very Good battery life. The touch sometimes is annoying, as the call drops when you touch the pod by mistake. Otherwise, it is an awesome product for both calls and listing to audio.",5.0

You can hear every minute details from a gaming perspective.Sound is clear and bass is too good.There are hardly any products outside at such a lucrative price.Go for it guys.",5.0 
184,Average to moderate sound quality with a competitive price tag,"As expected, in this price tag, one should not expect too much of the sound quality, the most important aspect of an audio device. Earbuds are great piece of engineering designed to be short lived, and this sophistication should come at a price. However, an ultra competitive market for these has created a mushroom growth of fancy looking earbuds, with minimal focus of the most important aspect: The Sound. No complaints however, we asked for these. Boats Airdopes 441 is no exception. To summarise my observations, with a bias towards the less said points are as follows:1. The product comes in attractive package. However, don't get swayed by it. If you notice with Sherlockian eye, you soon start finding the issues. The package has silly grammatical errors and style mismatch. For example, look at the bottom most line. What does it say?""This can done using the volume control on your bluetooth device...""A little above you will find ""Charging norms & Precautionary Guidelines"".Now take out the nice little box and turn over. 'Earbuds' battery' but 'Charging Box Battery' (see the image attached).Does it really matter? Yes. It reflects a company's care towards maintaining the brand image (Remember, what happened to Micromax?). It is particularly a shame, because India is a major English speaking country and their tag "" MADE IN INDIA BY AN INDIAN BRAND"" really doesn't go as per with these mistakes which arise from a careless  person who didn't have Grammerly installed in PC. Is it a deal breaker? No.2. Inside the box you will find a bunch of useless papers with photos of 'celebrities' claiming to use Boats and also a sticker for no reason. The charging case, however is attractive and well designed with a USB-C port. The case is not operable with one hand though, you need both.3. After opening, the experience was more or less smooth. Just after opening this Pandora's box, you will notice alternative green and blue lights flashing on the touch control, suggesting they are paired. Pairing is an ease, with little manual effort, particularly with an Android phone. Soon one earbud stops flashing, only one does inside the box, but they remain paired. Don't mistake it as a problem.4. As I said, Boat focused so much into the package and design, they probably forgot the most important thing: the sound quality. The little buddies are bass heavy, which means they will be really bad for instrument separation or high frequency music. As far as my testing goes, for calling and listening to audio stories, they work just okay.5. One good point is however it's waterproofing rating. It is IPX7 rated, unlike most of its competitors, which come with either IP4 or IP5 rating. Now, I haven't tested the waterproofing myself, but for heavy exercise, this works more or less fine. Not perfect, because I have experienced frequent disconnection between two buds, which can be restored by putting them into the case.So that's a list of my observations frequently not discussed. If you are fine with average sound, and with a budget, this can do the job. After all, number of reviews in any platform will tell you that these are extensively tested by a lot of people. And that is not without reasons.",3.0 
185,Poora review pdh lo smjh jaoge.,Hii guys!... I am writing a review because i was also reading reviews before buy the airdops... So I am using the airdopes for last 2-3 days. Sound quality is awesome. Battery life is exactly as mentioned in the descriptions. It also shows a battery sign on your phone like this🔋. Delivery is real fast thank to Amazon for that. Calling experience is really good. There is no noise from both the sides during the call. There is no automatically disconnection of calls. Connectivity is the best thing. Airdops connect to your phone as soon as you pick them out of the case after first time pairing process. Charging is really fast. Airdops fits in the ear very smoothly and comfortably.Is prize m yeh ek dm badiya product h yrrr m bhi aap hi k jese review pdh kr liya the inko to socha ki m bhi aane walo ki help kr doon review dekr to is liye kr diya.

At first the buds where shutting down in IOS (iPhone ) like crazy in every 15 minuteSo i stopped using it on my IOS and used it on my work phone which was android.

190,Excellent sound. Decent build quality. Touch sensor button,"I'm giving my honest feedback after using Boat Airdopes 441, Boat Airdopes 121 and pTron Bassbuds. If anyone have questions on comparison please ask ans I will try to reply all.Value for Money : Yes.👍 I would say it would be best buy if priced between ₹1600-₹1800.Sound Quality: Very good 👍 The bass and treble sharing is good. Its more on the bass side. Not excellent but not annoying. You will enjoy some good music in these buds.Noise Cancellation: Yes 👍 I should warn you not to use while doing anything that requires your attention. Even if its raining heavily outside you wont hear a thing.Bass Quality : On a scale from 1 to 5 I would give a 4.Audio: Doesn't hurt your eardrums if you maintain volume between 30%-70%. 121model sounds best around 50% while 441model sounds best around 70%.Body: Perfect 👌 The case is hard and lid is tight enough. Its magnetic lid hence its not as tight as a groove. However lid wont open by itself.Battery: Pretty Good battery life. Both on buds and case. Lasts almost 4-6 hours based on usage. U can charge 3 full and a little bit more on both earbuds.Design & Fit : Very sleek design and fits perfectly inside ear. Can't make out that u r wearing it. Use suitable silicon buds. The extra grip included in design keeps the earplug intact. It wont fall even while jogging or dancing.Features : Added features include touch sensitive buttons. U need not press which makes it less annoying bcoz pressing a button when it is stuck deep inside ear is irritating. It includes Water Resistance, you wont get in trouble in slight drizzle or droplets of water/sweat on the button.Calling : I didn't find any problem in calls however I wouldn't suggest this for calling. The other person might hear your voice aa if inside a tunnel. Gradually call quality will decrease, I speculate.Final Opinion ::Its a very good product. I felt price could have been lesser. Fits inside ear perfectly and sound is too good. Battery doesn't drain fastHowever your phone battery might, if continuously connected.The only gripe I have is that due to touch input we may tend to pause audio or open Google Assistance by mistake. Its very sensitive. You cannot wear and sleep because even if it touches your pillow surface audio will stop.I hope this feedback helps you decide better.RegardsVinay Acharya",4.0 
191,Best TWS from one of the largest brand.,"Boat used very good materials, you get earbuds, 1 case, 1 charging cable (no charger), extra ear rubber rings and rubber buds.Dropping don't cause any damage as well as these are waterproof so you can use them any weather.Fit in ears perfectly, even while running or jogging. Connectivity is super quick. You face no errors or anything and if did then simply can reset them in the case. Buy them for 2499 or less or simply buy 441 normal one the only difference is reverse charging with 2600mah battery is available in pro one. Otherwise both are same works 5+hrs easily.Well while calling, you get not much noice cancellation on offer but can make sure that your voice will be clear than bg voice. 3.8/5Sound quality is really good.",5.0 
192,Good for the price overall.,"//The case size is compared to my Noise Shots case in the pic//Insta pair works very well but beware the case is very slippery dues to matte plastic as least for me and cannot be opened with one hand at least not easily. The case hinge could have been better but it does feel premium in hand compared to other earbuds in this range. The bass is quite overpowering which I don't like cause it kills the actual music quality unless you like too much base. However on non bassy music it is good not great. You get a Type-C cable in box and 3 extra ear tips and 1 extra ear hook along with usual BoAt promotional stuff. Battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs on an individual bud. Fit my ear perfectly and won't fall off even while jogging. Although keep in mind the touch controls are very sensitive which is good but while removing them out of the case or your ear can accidentally reject calls , pause your content or reset the buds due to triple taps as the buds are small so you are definitely going to have accidental touches a lot. However the recent price drop in the Great Indian sale from 2499 to 1999 felt like a kick in the nuts because I bought them a week before the sale.",4.0

197,A Really Great Earbuds from an Indian Brand with a strong Battery backup.,"Great for all the activites whether for watching YouTube, Social Media, Amazon Prime, Online Lectures it works really great.Everybody has a different preference and thus taking into consideration this thing you may accordingly plan your purchase.I'm a not the active user of social media nor the YouTube, yet I really feel that this Earbuds are great for my usage as I earlier used the Samsung EarPhones which had a really nice sound and this too is the same.I haven't yet turned my media volume to more than 40% still the Audio is loud and clear for me. This also depends on the device you use as every device has it's own hardware capability. Even I use it at 25% volume it feels me not to go beyond this level.The images will make most things clear with respect to its appearance and design and the extra eartips included In the box.Points that you must take into account is:1: Your mobile device hardware capability( not the processor but the audio output )2: Your Usage in aggregate3: Your priority as to battery backup as it has 2600 mAh case. ( This 441 pro has a smaller variant  boAt 441 similar to it priced lower than this which has everything same but, a smaller battery case)4: Futher my order of usage will make it easier to think as if similar matches yours:  Online Classes/ Lectures sometimes live lecture too ; Music Songs ; YouTube ;Hence you must prior to purchase look after this and make a confident purchase.Conclusion:- I was earlier thought to purchase a cheap Chinese brand TWS, but later thought to increase my budget to get Earbuds from an Indian company rather than other chinese brand which merely does any innovation yet charges a considerable high price, leading them to their higher profit margin.boAt is an Indian Brand and this earbuds matched my usage and thus I loved them.",5.0

200,Excellent sound BUT READ BEFORE BUYING,Been using this for last 3 months. The sound quality is no doubt excellent but i paide 2400 not just for sound quality but also for the charging time.Both the ear buds are dead in 4 hours average and the power bank is only good for like 10-11 charges only. So in total like 45-50 hours of battery life in one charge. Even 800-900 rs earbuds can perform the same way. So its no value for money. And the power bank function for mobile I rarely use since phone chargers are way better option(fast charging and all) and it only charges like 40% of my 4400 mah battery. The connectivity is good most of times (8/10) and the mic does it's job. The touch works perfectly as wellVery good asthetics and great sound quality. Good warranty support.Go for other brand as 441(cheaper alternative) have lots of connectivity issues. But if battery life doesn't concern you much or you are okay to pay 1200 more for battery performance same as 800-900 ones provide go for this.,2.0

No adjustment required. I just place them in my ears and forget them.Good connectivity protocol. Just open the case and it gets connected and just put them back in the case and close it to off then / charge them. Pleasant. isn't it.Sound quality is between excellent and good.Cons:While listening to music, at times we notice momentary blank sound pockets in either of the earThe sensitivity of the touchpads is not so goodWhen playing a video; there is always a lag of around 100 microseconds between the video and audio you hear through these earbuds. Maybe Bluetooth Technology works that way.Calling experience:While using it for a call; audio keeps cracking for the listener on the other side. No issues on our side.Also, for wired earphones where-in we have the mic in front of our mouth it works efficiently. While for any earbud we always have the mic (in ears) behind the audio source (our mouth) and because of this mic needs to be extra strong to catch the forward projecting sound. This strength of the mic proves to be a big weakness for it - it also captures ambient sound with high intensity and makes it noisy for the listener on the other side.

I regret not having checked all the features. it lacks lot of things as below1) Auto connecting to multiple devices :  first of all in my one plus you have feature to shift automatically between one device to other, which is not here, after using this in one plus i feel it must. here you have to disconnect from one device and then connect in another device. it is said that it will always pair automatically with last device every time you open. but i see it not getting connected at times and manually I have to select.2) Touch controls :  these are super sensitive and annoying still after 1 month not able to understand what is the use. the only thing is that call gets disconnected immediately if you accidently touch it to adjust in your ears. for video/music playing it stop on touch3) No volume up or down feature in touch controls :  you have to do manually in the device only which you have connected4) Don't use for calling outdoor : This is the most pathetic part. outdoor you can use only for music/videos etc. if you are doing calling, the other guy can't hear you at all or will hear very weak voice from your end. infact the first piece that i ordered had issue in indoor calling etc as inbetween I was not able to hear anything from other caller, Also while having bluetooth connectivity on google meet/team meeting thru laptop it was failing, thankfully i replaced it immediately and atleast this new piece is not giving that much problem. however i am not using it regularly as one plus is much better and convienientEar fitment : these are quite big and does not fit well. i took it for my wife but she but these do not fit well, there are no additional ear pads given also.All in all this is not what i paid for. since there is no return option I have to keep it and regret",1.0

205,Sturdy and long lasting,"This is a review after 6 months of first purchase. I purchased my first pair of these earphones in December 2020.My first pair of earphones, unfortunately, got left in my pants and went through an entire wash cycle in the machine before being recovered.The interesting part is that even after being harshly spun and thrashed in soap water for over 15 minutes, the charging box and one of the earphones still work (without the touch which was basically the only drawback that my wife encountered and now they are perfect for her).Which is why I went for another one in March 2021.My second pair had a mild charging issue, so BOAT replaced the set for me and the new ones are working great!Coming to the pros and cons.PROS:1. Ridiculously sturdy and long lasting2. Good price3. Battery life is really good (on full charge, you can easily use these for days)4. Water and sweat resistance is excellent5. BOAT customer care is very good6. I use these for my workouts and they stay in place even while joggingCONS:1. The touch sensitivity is quite high so you may inadvertently press the earphones sometimes without intending to, but you get used to it fairly soon2. The charging cable is quite small, so I use my phone charger for it",5.0 
206,It is a Designed in India made in China product.,It works well. The dock is magnetised so that one can never put the pods in the wrong direction. The voice is loud and clear and the microphone also seems to work fine. Haven't tested it in noisy conditions so cannot vouch for the performance under extreme circumstances. Nevertheless works well when being used while cooking in the kitchen :-).The battery lasts long enough and it appears to stretch further as one tends to put it back in the pod receptacle for the fear of losing it. :-).Nice wireless in the ear pods.,5.0 
207,Pathetic battery life,"Let me state the positives firstSound quality is as per what you'd expect in this price range...Now the issue that made me give this a 1 star...Battery life is pathetic..I've always used both the earbud together, never used only one at a time.Within the first week, my right earbud started running out of the battery about 15 minutes before the left one. So the right one will switch off and the left one will go on for about 15 minutes more. I didn't think too much of it and used to put the buds back on charging once the right went out of battery.  BIG MISTAKE I should have returned them in 1st week itself.At this point right one used to last between 3.5 to 4 hours, and left one would last 15 - 20 minutes more if I continued using it.The time right lasted kept on decreasing and the time gap between how long right lasted and left lasted kept on increasing.And now about 8 months later it has come to a point where the right ones do not last more than 30 minutes!!!So I can't use my earbuds for more than 30 mins...I don't know how long the left lasts now if I continue using it because I've completely stopped using my earbuds. What's the point of only being able to use it for 30 minutes, as soon as I start using I just keep wondering when is it gonna say ""battery low""I find these earbuds a complete waste of money",1.0

The battry drainge rate of both the pods are not same. Means.. One down., still other keeps on going. That makes... U feel irritated.",5.0 
211,Best for the price.,"I would simply say, they are best for their price.I literally searched and watched videos and whatnot for a TON of products like this one, in this range.Reviews were there, but I always was sceptical. But then finally bought them for my sister.And happy to say, they are amazing.Just go for it. Don't waste time looking elsewhere.Note: READ THE MANUAL, even if it is boring. Because at times, you would feel that one earbud has stopped working, but it actually has not. It is a feature that allows only one bud to play. So please read the manual even if it may seem boring.My only deduction of 1 start would be for loudness. When I connect to my laptop, it does not get as loud as I would like it to, even at full volume. Could be my own problem, or maybe not.But for that price, and in that range, these are the best. I have recommended them to 4 people, and 3 of them bought them, and they all are happy so far. It has been 6 months or so.",4.0 
212,Not for regular use - In short not worth the amount you pay,"1. It is not comfortable to use for long hours. Your ears start paining if you wear for long.2. If the headphones were used by someone earlier, and you re-use them again, it remains connected to their device until it is disconnected from the previously used device. Say if the person is in meeting and you want to use these headphones, you can not use it until it is disconnected from another device.3. The top part of the headphones is highly touch-sensitive. Even when you adjust headphones, it changes the settings as the touch part is to change the setting.",2.0

214,Boats Airdopes 441 Pro Version Review after 2 days ( Will update after few days ),"Must read review to all those thinking to purchase the Beauty!!🤩Design:This is one area I liked the Airdopes very much...Beautiful❤️Looks premium with lighting..🔥Comfort and durability:Very comfortable with most ear sizes and creates a perfect noise free experience. You can use it while exercise or workout. They won't fall out of ears even with intense workout.This ones come with IPX7 Resisant which protects from sweat and splash.Sound and Audio Quality:As expected in most BOAT products, bass is always boosted and the audio quality is amazing. Details in music can be heard very crisply. The perfect noise cancellation has a good hand over here.Latency:There is a small amount of latency observed while playing PUBG. Very minor amount though. At this price point it's very observable. Realme buds Air have low latency and also they are bit expensive.Call quality:Excellent!!Battery Backup:Amazing. 2600mah battery backup upto 150 hrs. Still testing it out. Will update laterFeature:Touch sensors on them work well.More testing is left definately will update this review.",5.0 
215,Just another bluetooth earphones,"NOTE: To be very clear about bluetooth earphone device ( Information )Noise cancelling: This means this helps the wearer drown out ambient noise and focus on talking to someone. Which means it cuts down the noise around you not the person on call, so he will hearing everything.Noise cancelling Microphone: The bluetooth should have this option to cut down the noise around you and make your voice clear to the person you are speaking too.PROS: Good for music lovers, walking jogging etc..CONS: Bad call quality experience as the earphones does not have Noise cancelling microphone option.For this price point its good.Verdict: Incase you need it for calls, music and more Investing more money on bluetooth earphone will give you a great experience including Noise cancelling microphones etc..",2.0 
216,Amazing battery backup and fits well in ears: boAT airdrops,"I have tried the bluetooth based headphones (for cordless application) for the first time. But my experience with airdrops from Boat is excellent. The first thing which I felt good was that these fit in very well in our years due to the special rubber extenders present help fit into any ear without being painful. We can easily jog without fear of it popping out of your ears. The battery back up is very good, and the advantage is that the case retains the battery back up for over two weeks if one is using for one hour a day for exercise (which I use). But I am sure if one uses for 3 to four hours a day then it should surely last for over a week before you charge. It is very easy to charge to both directly from power source or from any power bank or phone. Extremely satisfied with sound quality, ease of stop, forward, reverse and play by tapping on the airdrops. Since they fit in very nicely to ear you need to remove one of them to talk to people.",5.0

219,Totally satisfied with this product. A very good option for bluetooth ear-buds.," It is no doubt a 5 star product.I have had boat products before and as its an Indian based company, I support it a lot. It's all a genuine opinion of mine. I bought boat rockers 400 on-ear headphones and for like 2 years they worked ,were awesome, and I had no issues ever. They still work! I just broke the plastic over head band ,but the electronics still work. It's great value for money.Then I bought this. For this let me say.I was going to buy 441 but kept it in my wishlist but then the pro version came,Nothing different but they added a big battery as a power bank! Simple but great idea. I have them now for 2 months and guess how many times I've charged it? Only once.The product is mind-blowing. I rarely give 5 stars to anyone except when it's Perfect. And it's perfect value for money.There is a rubber part around the earphones, you turn it and dude forget about them falling out. The pairing speed is Virtually nothing. See the video, it's paired. Open it and it pairs in 2 seconds (for device connected before of course) . Of course you can use it as a power bank too , you need a USB to whatever type your phone needs. It's awesome. Sound quality is also great and the range too. Seamless talks on calls clear audio.No doubt it's like 5th largest wearable electronics brand in the world. It's this excellent products they make.I'm proud of this company as an Indian too. Cheers.(One note: you have to take care with the capacitive touch on both the earphones during calls as even at slightest touch, it ends the call, happened with me a lot in the beginning)",5.0

What a great earbuds they are.Bass is super in it but sound quality is not up to mark as compared to Boat wired earphones.I can say that its a decent quality of sound. Its Case quality is very good, feels like something premium in your hand. Battery life is also great as it gives you 150 hrs play back tym. Great fit in my ears and my blue colour earbuds looks awesome. As compared to other Brand, no one brand can beat Boat Airdopes 441 pro.I played pubg also by using them and there is no sound lagg which is very impressive. You should definitely buy it. Its a complete package and gives you worth buying at a price of Rs2500. Finally got something after waiting for so long. Overall no brand can beat them and I loved it, I think everyone would love it after using it.",5.0

223,Worth every penny.,Boat surely knows how to provide customers with absolute value for the buck. The product feels premium. Easily feels like a 4-5k worth tws. It gets a C type charging port now that's something isn't common for tws buds. The sound is absolutely amazing. Yes they're bass oriented bit still overall sound quality is way too good for the price. I got them for 1600 during Diwali sale on Amazon so if your budget is within 2K then go for these without even comparing it to the other products at this price range.,5.0

225,Sweet offering for the price.,"For the price point, this is amazing.I like bass in my music and the product doesn't fail to deliver on that aspect. I sometimes have to talk loudly than normal but that could also be due to network issues. Connects seamlessly to devices too. The factory ear tips are soft but I may need to adjust it to a bigger one given in the box. Battery life is good too.",5.0 
226,Good for the price,"Okay, so I purchased this after much researching and checking out array of budget and premium earbuds/ pods. Each and everyone of it had mix reviews. I purchased these, with having an experience of great customer service from boat regarding any issues with the device, returns, warranty, etc. The more you search, the lesser options you'll see. I decided to go with this. Initial product was delivered the next day ( hats off to prime delivery) the device had some issue as it didn't disconnected and the call quality had some issues. I initiated a return, got a replacement. Had the same issue. Finally asked for a refund, and purchased another product, same seller just different product. It has been more than a week. Sound is clear, the bass quality is amazing. The call quality to the receiving end is good ( could be great) as it just has 6 mm drivers, nonetheless the quality is really good for 2400/- what I loved it when while working out ( cardio, HIIT and all) the ear buds didn't fall off. And given I was using it throughout the day. The buds are really light too. The touch controls are good as well. Over all it's a really good product.",5.0 
227,Need to work on quality of music,"Ok , I have used for couple of day and had experience on both front  . As a user as well as a listenerFirst. I will go with listener - voice is clear their is no humming sound from the other endOnly issue is when we say noise cancellation for listener then it is not their they can hear clear voice of what u are doing like playing with pen or opening of drawers etc.As a user - battery last for 4-5 hours which is good even when u play music,talk over call.Sound quality is good it is clear only issue is , it had too much of bass which kill quality of songs or other musical instrument music . So after you tend to remove them from your ears.Wearable- it is easy to wear even during sports activities like jog , walk . They can hold on all jurk . Still not tested in water 😁 but I am not going to dare it.",4.0 
228,High quality beautiful ear phones!,"I have been using these air dopes for about a week now. The dopes are sleek small and fit well into the ear. When on, I only get to hear the music and nothing on. The dopes are responsive, sometimes a little too much as a simple touch can pause / skip / or start new song.The case is good. Only thing to watch out will be to see how long the lids last given the usage.Battery backup is great. I used it 4 hours at a stretch without any issues and atleast 15 hours with one charge of the case. The sound quality is great for the price of the air dopes. Easy to use and beautiful looking too. Overall a great purchase!",5.0 
229,Fair review,Got my earphones before the date.. Thanks amazon for faster delivery. Earlier product it got was defective as its rubber was torn and right piece speaker was not clear at other end. But it was replaced very early. Using this tws for almost one month. I use it mainly for calling purpose. Right piece is good for calling as the person on the other end can hear me clearly but with left piece other side is not that much clear. So boat must provide clarity on both pieces.For music purpose boat is as usual good.Battery backup is good. And case get charge fast.There must be a option to stop blinking of led. Sometimes it is irritating,4.0 
230,Overall good product from Boat but there just one thing I hate about it.,"The product is overall extremely good who want to use it for music and calls both. Music stream delay is hardly noticable but sometimes delay can be observed if you're streaming in HD/4k quality on YouTube or other platform. Calling is really good. I talked to my friend on call in busy streets of Mumbai and he was able to hear me with much noise in the background, so recommended for calling as well. Microphone on this TWS is unbeatable by any other brand in this price range. I have 3 TWS and none of them can beat the sound and mic quality of this one.THE BIGGEST CON:I was talking to my colleague on call while I was walking and suddenly the left earbud ran out of battery and I was only left with one earbud to attend the call which is hard because you hear noise from the other ear. I had to close my ears with my hand to listen. If you intend to call only from house then this is good to go.I think both earphones must run at the same time and must provide equal battery life.",4.0

Its providing a nice bluetooth coverage around 8-10 m for me( in open) with out any voice breakage or distractions.Cons:-1.Outer cover lid is made of cheap plastic especially hinge.2.Blue tooth connectivity is bit slow3.Capacitive touch sceen is not tgat much responsive. this is the main pblm i felt.All over if we compare all tgese i feel this is some thing good at this price.,5.0 
233,Great sound quality.. good battery capacity.. no mute option,"Hi I ordered this earphones as I needed to multitask with my kid and taking office calls. The ease of use is great and ear buds fit well. Also the battery life is quite good .. I use it for  almost 2 hours daily and i charge it once in 2-3 days. A couple of changes I would prefer, the end call is super sensitive and one needs to be very careful not to touch earphones when the call is on going else you’ll get dropped off. Also there is no option to mute the call by touching the earphones. This would be super helpful to go completely hands free.",4.0

I was a bit tensed on reading the reviews before getting the buds on hand. But when I put them on my ears, guys, believe me all my doubts vanished. The sound quality is so great considering the price of the buds.  You guys can blindly go for the buds without any hesitation.But one thing I must say considering the latest price 3499, its a bit overpriced. Thankyou",4.0

236,Worst customer service,I bought in May2021. The product was dysfunctional with in 2weeks of purchase. I raised complaint in the boat website and it was picked up by Bluedart for service. But I didn't receive any communication from Boat later. I tried to contact boat customer care multiple times and could reach after multiple attempts initially. Got excuses from them citing COVID. But no response later. So far I called customer care 10times. Each time only apologies and excuses from them. Not even a single email from them. I sent copy of acknowledgement of Bluedart pickup also. Very apathic and callous response. I literally feel my product is lost.,1.0

Very light weight.case is also nice, You dont have to keep it on charging always.Fancy lights on the touch panel really looks good.it's good one in this range.Problem:Touch is very sensitive. By the time you open and try to put it in ear, it turns off if you kept your finger on the touch panel.I would have liked gew more features like touch response to finger only, With some apps pause play is not supported.but it has all the basic features.",4.0

239,Stopped working after 10 days - Worst Customer Support and low quality Product,Product is good. Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation are good not as good as the high end items but for the price under 2500 these air dopes are good. These works well with the phones. But these are not useful for webex meetings on laptop (Other side cannot hear you).. But the one side of Air dopes stopped working after 10 days. And the Boat Support is very lengthy. Though it is well structured it takes a huge lot of time to replace or repair the product. I had raised a support ticket on Boat Support portal on 10th of October 2020 and today is 19th ot Oct 2020. The product is still in transit and not yet reached the Boat store (Mumbai) where they will verify and repair or replace the product. Whole process takes 18-20 Business days as per them. No Boat support center near by in Hyderabad city to repair the product. It has to be sent to Mumbai where they will repair the product. This is too big process.Update 28/Oct/2020: Product sent for repair on 10th Oct 2020 and until now I didn't hear any update on when the product will be repaired or replaced. Worst customer support. Can't connect to BOAT Support Center. I'm going to raise Complaint in Consumer Court.,1.0 
240,Okayish TWS with a crippling issue,"For the price, can't complain about the sound signature. Passive noise cancellation, especially while playing music isn't half bad either. Connecting to a device/switching connections though - I have honestly not used a device this bad in connecting to devices in a decade. Either it keeps disconnecting, or only one of it plays any sound. All the rules in the manual is of no help either. Buy this if you're only going to ever connect this to ONLY ONE device in it's entire lifetime and not even think of trying to connect it to a new device after you've set up the first one. Also, most of the steps to factory reset/""fix common problems"" in the manual does not work. This fundamental flaw just cripples the entire experience.For Boat: please fix conection issues! You're killing your own product with an issue that has been solved a decade back.Update (Apr 2021): after ""trying"" to use these for the last 4-5 months, I have come to the conclusion that these are a literal waste of money. Buyers beware - if you're getting good connectivity and your earphones are working fine, that's awesome. But you really shouldn't risk your money on this. Please DO NOT buy this. I cannot speak for any other Boat products, but definitely recommend against this one. Never going to try Boat earphones personally.",1.0

In stereo mode ( both ear-buds in use ) the sound you get on each earbud is different that’s how stereo works, you can’t complain this as one side is buzzing other side is good, That’s INSANE STUPIDITY IF YOU COMPLAIN LIKE THAT.And some stupid people says that Call gets disconnected, You morons, it’s a touch assistive ear-bud if u touch it to adjust the earbud in ur ear during a call, it gets disconnected, isn’t this OBVIOUS?

I fell in love with this product from the first use itself. The sound quality is AMAZING!! The features make it so easy to use. And it has that asthetic appeal to it.But, but... I was facing difficulties with mic, remember? This was especially with the laptop. Hence, I applied for the replacement. They brought the new pair in just a couple of days. But the problem still persisted with the new pair as well!! I was worried about having wasted the huge amount of money.But then I spent some time understanding the product. And found that the problem wasn't, in fact, with the product, but with the settings on my laptop. I had to increase mic volume on my laptop for them to work better!!I also found out another thing. While there is a mic on both the earbuds, only one of them works at a time. And the one working is the one that you picked out first from the box. So keep that in mind. This is not mentioned in the manual. (May be they should -_-) So, this ultimately resolved all my issues with the earbuds, and now I'm a very happy customer of these awesome earbuds. I would say, if you are OK with spending this much amount, just go for these ones!! You won't be disappointed!!!",5.0 
245,Best VFM earbuds your money can buy,"People.The product is exactly as described and met all my personal requirements (Comfort, sound quality, ear-fit, water-proofing, style, budget etc). I did a lot of research and found this to the Best Value For Money (VFM) ear-buds. The best part (which I was actually quite concerned about) is that they don't budge while running/working out. Although there is no active noise cancellation, it has passive noise cancellation which is awesome at this price range.Also, it comes with a chic and handy carrying/charging case which has USB-C charging and fully charges my earbuds within less than 2 hours. By the way, this charging case has a massive battery life (I have not charged my case ever since I received from Amazon which was in sometime in mid-November and must have recharged my earbuds at least 15-20 times - no exaggerations here.)I am fully satisfied and am sure that you shall be too.Happy listening and working out.Cheers !!!",5.0 
246,Recommended if You are Looking for Just Music,"Writing this review after 6 months of usage.These earbuds are perfect when you want to use them just for listening to the music. The bass is perfect and audio output is truly marvellous. Battery life is also good. With the pods, it will give you backup of around 4 days. Touch is also quite sensitive.However, when it comes to mic, it is horrible. There is no noise cancellation (which is expected at this range) and you have to literally shout while speaking if you want your self heard. In a closed room, the performance is slightly better but not upto the mark. More trouble is there when you connect it with laptop. Mic performance is awfully bad.Overall, if you are looking for an earbud just for music streaming and can compromise with the mic, go for it.",4.0

Other TWS is more of vanilla when compared to this.Coming to build quality: Im more than satisfied since after 6 months usage i have dropped it here and there but thankfully no damage yet.Sound quality is comparable to other market competition such as one plus buds, mivi etc.Battery life is commendable, after daily usage of 3-4 hrs and charging box 2 times a week.If you are for the looks and ok with sound quality dont hesitate go for it.",5.0 
254,Product is ok Quality but Amazon service is awesome,"Review after 9 month usage.Pros: The sound quality and noise cancellation are good.Cons:1. The battery is horrible. The right ear pod loses battery quickly. And within a year the battery and charging case are not able to hold up much charge.2. The touch part is horrible. If you're listening to music lying down and you turn to your side and the touch sensitive part of the pod touches the pillow, it pauses music, and even turns off as if it has been done by a finger.3. The notification voice is super irritating! I don't want someone to say, ""Oops! Battery Low!"" to me everytime the battery is low, which is very often. A simple beep can do justice to the notification.",3.0

256,Best AUDIO  ==> high CONNECTIVITY  ==> most COMFORTABLE fitting - Must buy,"Product was quite good for listening music Don't expect Premium bass levels.I think all the pros are mentioned in detailed product description let's talk about cons:1. After fixing in the ears for 20 minutes and above you might feel slight ear pain2. Attending calls are quite easy but either you nor them can't listen opposite person voice after 10 mins ( happened to me everytime might be I received a defective piece)3. If you are frequently going outdoor I don't recommend this product better go for neckband type ( because everytime you need to put the airdopes in the dedicated case to power it off)4. Designed in such a way, you can't find the one if you lost it ( Easy to pairup also easy to lose)5. Case is not easily fitting in pocket, always you need something to store the case which stores the airdopes 😂",5.0 
257,Static noise,"I ordered this Airdopes set mainly for taking work related calls through communication technologies like Slack, Microsoft Teams etc. The initial set I received worked well but had two issues:1. The left hand side airdope kept disconnecting and reconnecting.2. The call quality was good, but the other party could barely hear me.I pondered over a poor review, but then I changed my mind and checked boat's website. I got their support email and sent them my invoice details. I had barely sent the email when I got a response telling me to keep it ready in a box (any box other than the original box) for pickup. The next day, the delivery exec from Boat had picked it up. I got an acknowledgement email stating that the set had been duly received and that they would be shipping a replacement for me. It was supposed to take 15-20 days. But surprise surprise! It was delivered in 3 days, and now this set is working perfectly. Comfortable, light, looks durable, sounds good and the microphones are definitely good!I'm so glad to have waited before putting in my review. The person at the other end has no trouble hearing me and the buds stay in sync without getting disconnected. I don't have any intention of using this to listen to music, but whatever I have heard while being on hold has sounded really good.Overall I'm very satisfied. And one appeal to everyone - please don't leave a poor feedback based on one experience. Do reach out to their customer support. They are very easy to work with. It might take a a few more days, but these Airdopes are worth it. Sincere thanks to Boat for their wonderful customer service and Amazon for bringing this product to us!",3.0 
258,Bang for buck,"1. The music quality is very good especially bass.2. More ergonomic design so that it fits perfectly into ears so that you can even ride bicycle, bike, walk, run and do exercise without fear of dropping.3.

Only drawback is that in small spaces like small rooms, the mic captures more background noice during calls.",5.0

I felt battery durability could have been even better for the price we  are paying i.e. 2469 odd rs5. it has some issues with the call .i used this pods for some calls as soon as I bought it the other person on call couldn't hear at some  point of time because of some random disturbance, and once I took it off the call was clear6. though they give u the c type cable they don't give u the adapter so pls read the instructions clearly before charging ur case and hope u burn down the case by using the wrong adapters.7. the pods don't have the feature where it tells u if u have worn the pods properly like in air pods (in air pods it tels u when the pods are lost)8. same model doesn't come in girly colours if incase u are looking out for pink or if u are expecting whiteoverall I wud say its amazing go for if u feel all the features u wanted are not there then you can go for the ones having most of the features if not all but the price is dramatically high..",4.0 
261,Very comfortable in ear pieces,"Been using the product since a day now. I'm not stunned by the quality but I'm abundantly satisfied with the purchase. The controls will take sometime getting used to, keep the user guide handy for quick reference for sometime till you get accustomed.The earpieces are comfortable, the sound quality great and it easily paired with my iPhone X and Macbook. Since the product supports mono functionality as well, it may cause confusion sometimes - My left earphone paired with my laptop and the right one paired with my phone at the same time. It was a bit surreal.Great product though. At the price point, I highly recommend a purchase!",5.0 
262,"It's fine, wireless and looks modern, that's all there is to it","Love the battery life. I'm quite new to the TWS market. Bought thus airdopes 441 pro for my dad. My cheaper 700rs Sony and JBL CS series headphones have much better audio richness and audio spacing depth. This airdopes are fine too. But I'm not impressed at all. With equalizer, I play around with it to find a better sound suit for me but still, these 700rs wired headsets do much better.Calling too isn't that good, I sit for meetings with this and I often get people from the opposite saying I sound distant or voice level is low. I don't think this has noise cancelations, haven't properly checked that.Overall, this thing is portable, wireless and works on Bluetooth, cool technology stuff, that's all. Not meant for audiophiles and calling purposes.If you gift this to old people like your parents and grandparents, they'll love it.",4.0

Not sure about the outside.This airdopes is not good for gaming. You will hear the gun sound after one sec. But if you want the airdopes for music and calling indoor, its a good one.Sometime, both airdopes doesn't pair, you simply need to put it back in the case and then open it, it will solve the problem, or factory reset. That's not a big problem I guess. If you know how to wear the airdopes, then there will be no fitting issue.Battery back up is good.Overall, I like the air dopes.

267,Faulty Product offered with heavy discount,"The heading sums up everything. The touch panel (CTC) has manufacturing defect. I am writing this after using two productsts. In first case the right bud stopped completely after 2 days of use. Its ctc used to be very sensitive and you will struggle getting correct output basis touch command. In second case, the ctc had no touch response. No light signal, lying dead after its removal from the case, especially the right side one. I tried, restarted, made the factory reset several time, tried different pressure points just to keep my new buds with me and wasted several hours. But response was not encouraging. Sometimes it responded, sometime it simply ingoned my touch command, in the middle of my call, listing music. Finally, with heavy heart i have requested return of this product. The reason for my heavy heart is the music sound quality. Its a good buy (even as a faulty product) for Rs. 300 budget (max), for those who just wish to listen music. Totally unhappy with the product.",1.0

269,Good sound quality with pathetic connectivity,"Sound quality is good but very inconsistent connectivity. The pairing was easy but no longevity in connection. Either one of the buds disconnects frequently which is a huge headache while working out since you won't carry the case with you. I was tempted by the IPX7 certification but trust me this is a huge letdown.I have replaced this product 2 times as one of the earbuds was dead 2 times. This is something you should worry about. So you cannot trust the lifespan of these earbuds, it could be the end the very next minute. My suggestion would be to go with any brand which has better service/support after-sales",2.0 
270,overall review,"TALKING ABOUT THE BOAT AIRDOPES 4411) Look and feel - It is tremendous, compact and has a premium look, it fits into the pocket easily and it is also very light weight. The black colour is loved by many people so does me!  There are also other options available, you can watch them too!2) Sound quality - The name 'Boat' itself is a representation of Perfect and loud sound and also the king of base. The sound is loud and clear and also the base is excellent and I would definitely love to recommend to the user who loved loud music and also want the perfect base.The call quality was good as per the price. The other user on phone was able to hear me clear.Along with that, they have provided us with the earhooks so that it doesn't get off from the ear and it just blocks your ear perfectly and you don't have to be tensed about it's falling off from the ear. Also it's IPX rated so it is water resistance with a type C charging.The charging time of the case and buds are good as per the price.If I summerise overall, then You must definitely choose this 'BOAT AIRDOPES 441' that would contain everything including loud sound and base and also sleek and compact case which gives a premium look.OVERALL , you can go for it!",5.0 
271,Did i get on the wrong boat?,Good earbuds but no difference between 441 and 441 pro except the powerbank feature.

272,"Good battery life, but sound quality is bad","It is just rambling bass, with many details lost while listening to music. It responds well to EQ, but problem persists. I bought it for a specific purpose - listening to recorded calls - it serves me well. Battery life is good. Passive isolation is nice. Personally, I did not want to spend a fortune over something which would die in 2 - 3 years. These TWS are also bad for calls. It prioritises background noise over call. Also, they're not good for ladies with long hair. A single strand of hair is enough to stop or pause whatever you are doing - the touch is too sensitive.PS: Though it doesn't bother me, they are made in China. Also, TWS technology has a long, long way to go.",2.0 
273,It's a PERFECT BOAT!,"I was skeptical about the product quality and sound. But, it's a boat product and even though it might be made in china the quality is as always good.The headphones and charging case looks and feel premium. It's light weight and small in size, you can carry it in your skinny jeans too.Sound is awesome as you expect from a boat product but bass is not at par with boat bassheads. Battery life and charging is almost same as mentioned in product description. No need of ANC as the earbuds fits perfectly in ears isolating the environment sounds.Capacitive touch is very sensitive and will react on unwanted touch. You can't control volume nor you can switch off the earbuds nor you can connect multiple device at once nor you can use earbuds as solo. An app that can be used to change the touch functionality and music equalizer would have been helpful.Overall 3.5 stars for sound and quality. Best buy below 2k.",3.0 
274,CHINA PRODUCT. NO NOISE CANCELLATION. TOUCH OUT OF TOUCH.,"Not worth it!No noise cancellation makes it extremely difficult for receiver to hear the conversation. Even a fan in the background makes it unbearable to talk. The ultra sensitive touch on both pods gets the calls disconnected every time you try to adjust the pods in your ears. Would surely not recommend this product.Branding online says it is an Indian Company. However when received the product, it mentions MADE IN PRC (Peoples Republic of China).  Surely misleading and ethically incorrect.Tried to return the product and did not give me an option for Returns as well.",1.0 
275,Great for this budget.,"Previously, I used Redmi Airdots for almost a year or so, and back in October, I finally decided to upgrade as I was facing a few problems with it, related to battery and usability. And after using BoAt Airdopes 441, I can say for a fact that these are generations better than Airdots. Not only do they have extremely rich sound quality, but the bass is very noticeablely deep. The fit is very nice, and can be used while working out. The battery is everlasting, and the biggest pro about these wireless earbuds is the bluetooth 5.0  as it's extremely quick, and easy to connect. Definitely an easy buy for this budget.",4.0

278,A technical review; I am no sound quality expert,"This is a decent ear bud pair in this price range. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I haven't faced anything I'd call a problem till now. Here are a few pros and cons per me (but my views will definitely be relative and driven by my expectations); please note that I won't talk about sound features but I usually use this for phone calls, business meetings, etc., and it gets my work done nice & easy:Pros:1) Light weight2) Boots up instantly upon opening the case3) Decent range (tested for > 10m)4) Bluetooth 5.0 (but also supports 4.x)5) Stable mono mode (either bud can be used independently, without stereo features)6) Stereo ear buds (when both work together)7) Seamless auto-pairing between the two buds8) Quickly reconnects with previously paired deviceCons:1) Learning curve involved to understand all features and touch controls2) Light coding can get a bit confusing at times (but this is more of a feedback to UX designers of this product and has no performance impact on the buds once you've got a hang of all that those lights mean)3) For some people, battery back up can be a bit less but please do take a look at the size and weight; plus, don't forget the mono mode",5.0 
279,Excellent Sound but major connectivity issues,"The sound quality is excellent (for the price). Good bass quality is only felt after 65% volume. Noise cancellation is good.

Listen at low or medium volume only.Also, I can hear the air in the ear (Extra feature) :-(Touch controls are excellent and work as expected.My only concern right now is that one of them keeps on showing red light whenever I pull them out. They do pair automatically, but most of the time one of them just switches off. I am not able to use it in mono mode.Maybe a reset is required that I will give it a try.Was worth a purchase during the deal only. Otherwise, I feel they are too costly for this price and features.",4.0 
281,Great product delivered in a tampered packaging!,"Very happy with the product but very disappointed with the fact that the box was already tampered with when delivered by Amazon. The original seal was ripped off and pasted randomly on the box and a separate seal was applied on the box (refer the photographs for reference). In all likelihood, this is a product that was returned by some other customer and Amazon hasn't bothered to check the packaging before shipping it out to me. While the product looks brand new / unused and seems to be working fine, this experience has left me extremely skeptical as to whether or not these would last and give me the reliability and performance of a brand new product.As for the product in itself, it is great and delivers on aesthetics, build quality, sound (great bass for the price!) as well as ease of use. Fits comfortably in the ears and can be used for long periods of time without any irritation / uneasiness. The charging dock is small enough to easily fit in the pocket and I really like the overall touch and feel of the product. All in all, would definitely recommend it if you're looking for reasonably priced airbuds!Hopefully, you would receive these in a brand new packaging without any tampering..",4.0

If there is little fluctuation of internet or anything during calls, it stops working and robot kind of sound starts coming.

Not great for music, as the bass is substandard.3. Can't be used as workout pods, as they are not tight.4. touch is over sensitive, pauses if anything even brushes against it.Over All:Good for a single user with single device, for gaming and calls.I was planning to use on my Phone and TV, it just doesn't connect to TV unless I switch off Bluetooth in my phone. Similar problem can be faced if any of your family member wants to share it.",3.0

Battery backup of the power bank is excellent and lasts more than a week if used a couple of hours daily.",4.0 
287,"Great product! Go for it, this won't disappoint.","I received this 2 days after ordering. Got it on the lightning deal @ 2499. So far, I've been using it for approx 4 hours continuously and haven't faced any problems. Now here's the stuff you are reading this review for :1. Fits super snugly in the ears. I've shakwn my head every which way, jumped around, vigorously too,  and even fallen asleep with these on. They haven't fallen out even once. Yeah maybe if you get punched in the face they could fall off, but i haven't tested that yet! If you use the right earbud size it will fit better i guess. The earcaps are pretty useless in this regard though. They do nothing. Just use the right earbud size ans push it in properly.2. Sound quality is great like you expect from any boat product. The bass is what you bought this for and it won't disappoint. I tested this at both safe and full volumes on my samsung m21 and while the full volume won't make your ears bleed, it's powerful enough to make you uncomfy after 5 minutes. In safe volume state, these are pretty great. Of course i compared these with the brand new boat bassheads 225 i have, and the output from those is louder at the same volume. But that's what i have noticed in a lot of boat products, their bluetooth stuff plays a little softer at the same volume when compared to the regular earphones.Clarity is otherwise good and everything is balanced. You won't need to tweak with the equaliser unlike what happened with the Boult earphones I've used.Call quality is pretty decent too. You can hear the person clearly, no problem there. My friend did say that she could hear my voice clearly, though it'd sound better if i was louder, but I'm in general a very loud speaker. So there's that.3. Looks pretty decent when worn. The touch controls are a little confusing to gt used to without reading the manual 2 times or more. Of course the touch controls are great, but not too fast. They have some delay.4. Charging takes about 1 hour and a bit more. I haven't tested them for how long they can go without another charge so that's next to come.5. The case looks super cute though? It's got a matte finish and you get 3 pairs of earbuds and that earcap thing, a charging type C cable and warranty card and manual.These aside, i can't come up any more points. I hope this review helps.P. S. : i got the bumblebee yellow.",5.0

289,Value for money buy !!!,"I got this on my birthday on 21st June :) Was initially skeptical regarding the quality of TWS earbuds. But having used other Boat earphones in the past made me go for this over other brands.Using it since unboxing on 21st June and even after 2 days of heavy usage, the charge is still available in the box. Earbuds can go on 4-5hrs on a single charge. Battery backup is indeed good as advertised.Music quality is very good just like any other Boat earphones.Call quality and noise cancellation is better than what I had expected.Haven't tried gaming mode as I am not a gamer but I expect it will be good too.Earbuds are comfortable to the ears even after continuous usage and fit to the ears well.Box pack comes with extra ear tips and a USB Type C charger.Its really worth spending Rs 2500.",5.0 
290,Satisfactory,"Product is an average one the sound quality is good and the bass is average, Noise cancellation is 3.6/5 and the battery back up is between 2-3.5 hours based on the purpose. Better battery back up when using volume between 70-80%. One replacement buds offered with the product for quite smaller ear size. Type C charging is faster but using QC or Turbo or Vooc for charging might create heating issues standard charger will do. Use one at a time to have better usage cycle.",5.0 
291,Value for money,Very good airdope and very beautiful look wise also better sound quality but it's not louder. Infact when your volume label on 80+ than you can real enjoy any song. So i think volume/louder factor should have been better. Clearity and connectivity is outstanding. Specially connectivity distance performance is best in class. No any pain feeling on my ears. Great fixed with both ears. I will give the feedback later about battery backup. Overall it's a great product under this budget 2.5k.,5.0 
292,Okay product. Go for the Pro model,"The claimed battery life of 3 hours is not there, thus I would recommend to go for the Pro model with 5 hours of battery life.Otherwise, product is good, lightweight and decent looking.I used it for my Zoom calls and other webinars.

293,"What's the point of buying these bluetooth earphones at ₹2000,if they last only for less than a year","I bought Airdopes 441 Blue in October last year on Amazon. The Earphones worked just fine for 3/4 months, since then the rapid degradation started.....the right earphone lost its volume(minimal output), and since last month the left earphone which was performing at optimal level lasts only about 10 mins.I am still within my warranty period but the claim process is abysmal. I am based in capital city of Odisha and there's only one recognised service center to claim warranty. they don't pickup calls and are 20kms away from me. In these covid times travelling there is very difficult for me.I WISH bOAT introduces online warranty claim and replacement service. i mean brands like senheise,sony provide online replacement within a week. VERY DISSAPOINTED....i bought a Sony earphone now and never looking forward to buy a bOAT product in future.MY POINTS;1. Didn't last a year2.Difficult & unresponsive Warranty claim process.3. Yes I paid around ₹ 2000 for using a Bluetooth earphone for 10 months.NEVER AGAIN bOAT!!!!!!!!",1.0 
294,Buzzing noise!,Buzzing noise coming from right side bud.

295,"Nice earbuds, good sound quality!","My first true wireless earbuds! Very good sound quality. Bass is nice, though not very thumpy (I don't prefer very high bass anyway, masks lows). Good battery life as well, full charged once and after 8 days still going strong, though I use for around 1 hour of listening in one go. Case is good, instantly connects to mobile/tablet. Touch controls are good, too sensitive for my liking though. Comfortable to wear as well, you need to find best position for your liking that's it! I have forgotten to take them off a couple of times after listening, these are that comfy! Overall nice buds.",4.0 
296,Terrible touch buttons! Slow clap to boat for thinking this design is practical!,"No complain about the sound quality, it's good in this range. But what irked me to write this review, it's earpod's touch buttons, they are nightmares!This product is such a waste of money because of the touch buttons alone, I can't rest my kneck on either sides because it pauses the music or the video I'm watching. Same goes for call. Terrible concept Boat! Slow claps. The only satisfaction I'm getting from this waste of a product is by informing people and save their money!",2.0 
297,"Good bass, superb noise cancellation.",These are one of the best ear phone in that price range.. they fit in-ear nicely and anr comfortable over extended length of time.The noise cancellation is superb..!!! Like you literally can't hear anything from the outside..The bass quality is great especially if you use both the dopes simultaneously...The touch panel is sensitive and functional.The only drawback is that the volume can only be controlled by your phone as there is no volume control function on the eardopes.,4.0 
298,Here's my review of the product,"Sound quality:- Good for it's price range. The sound leans a little bit on the treble side but it has sufficient lows. I was actually surprised by the sound quality considering that it is a bluetooth earphone at the 2.5k rangeControls:- The touch sensitive controls are hit-or-miss. They are very well done and very responsive but the downside is that, it's easy to trigger it unintentionally. If your ear itches or you want to adjust your hair or something else, you can accidentally ""press"" the button by gliding your finger over it. Another issue is when using it when lying down, if any skin (usually earlobes or auricle) glazes over the touch sensitive buttons, your video/song might accicentally pause or if it rests on it for 3 or more seconds, the device can accidentally turn off. But mind you, it's just minor issue and not a delibitating one. I'm just noting it down here for future improvements.Connectivity:- This is one thing I love about these earphones compared to others I have owned. It connects easily with your phone, as well as with the other. For example:- You're using only one of the buds, with the other one in the box; after sometime you want to use both of them, you only have to take it out, it'll turn on and sync itself automatically with the other bud. I'm just mentioning this here because with every other bud I have owned, you need to manually resync both buds everytime.Latency:- This earbuds have a signal latency/delay of 200ms. This is pretty low compared to other earbud and neckbands I have tried out and owned. Latency is a non-issue for basic usage but is a big issue for gamers, and 200ms signal latency is very very forgiveable for games (eg:- codm, pubgm, etc) and this is the most useable earbud/neckband I have used for gaming so far (for the record I have tried out 5-7k inr earbuds that have 500-600ms latency.. and this little guy beats them all). As per my experience, any delay that is at or below 200ms delay is useable/forgiveable for gaming. Anything above 200ms, is useless. Sure, zero latency wired earphones are the best for gaming but given this product comes under 2.5k, have good sound quality and connectivity, the ease of use and quality-of-life thing they offer is a very good compromise for the 200ms delay.Overall:- This is an excellent product for it's price range and I recommend it for basic usage as well as gaming",4.0 
299,Good Bluetooth earbuds within 3.5k range.,"Here is my review of the boat airdopes 441 pro earbuds after using it for two days since purchase.ProsSound quality is good. Balance between the highs and lows with balanced treble and bass.Lightweight.Attractive colors.Good battery backup.ConsCall quality poor, not meant for calls.Finishing not that great, could have been better. For example in the charging case the type c port and usb cable port area. You can tell by looking at the enclosure itself which gives the impression of cheap chinese product, not expected for aesthetic point of view , personally I didn't liked the specifications written in the bottom of the charging case with white color, it destroys the aesthetics of the product.Aptx support not available whereas the same is available in this budget.",4.0

If i try to say that i,ll myself come to the boat service center they simply say that it is closed now.This is the excuse they are giving me from the last 15 days everytime i try to complain or ask them for help.I'll never buy any BOAT product in my life.After paying 2.5k for a thing and getting no service is such a terrible thing.Not only this i bought boat stone speaker too same battery issue after charging for 3 hrs it does not even works for 30 mins such a poor quality they are providing to their customers.",1.0 
301,Good for Music but Bad for Calls,Pros1. Good for music. I have had no disconnection on blue tooth during playing music.2. Build quality is good but could be better.3. Bass is ok types not very good but ok.4. Battery life is also good.Cons.1. Frequent disconnection of bluetooth on calls. Suddenly on calls the eardopes go off air. Big time embarrassment when you cannot hear what the other person has said and you end up missing important conversation. This is my return and the same problem persists and I am returning the product second time.2. No volume or noise cancellation.3. Dual mic missing in each eardope so calls are not good. you need to speak too loud so that the other person hears you.Overall above average type of product for music lovers only. Do not buy if you will use it for calls also.,3.0 
302,Microphone may not work with Windows,"This works only with Phones - Android/iOS. It connects as a voice/music device to Windows 10, however the microphone output is not working. The headphones are not useful for Windows 10 laptop for calls. It uses Microsoft driver for the headset handsfree handling, and clearly Microsoft is not able to use Boat Airdopes 441.I cannot believe they will ship headphones which don't work with Windows. Get this fixed, sending feedback to them separately as well.Update - On the third windows 10 machine I tried, the microphone works. So your experience will wary. I am not able to make it work with other two machines. Microphone quality is not something to write about, however that is what one would expect at this price point.",3.0

They kept me posted about the progress at each step.

Sometimes even disconnects in only one bud and reconnects, giving you a horrid experience when listening to music.8)cannot adjust volume using ear buds.

They work fine for the first three months, then one of the earbuds stops accepting charge. In another 2 months, the other one stops accepting charge. But they never mention this... They just die in 2 minutes each time they need to be used.The pins on the box don't sit properly on the earphones, the lid keeps opening, the earphones drop out of the box relatively easily.. The only thing they are good for, really, is as a powerbank. But, then I'd rather have bought a bigger powerbank.Boat customer support seems nonexistent. No one responds to calls.

320,Noise cancelation Not at all effective,"It is okay if you use it in stationary, static position with mouth shut throughout. It's definitely not for sports or even walking. You hear the thumping of your foot when walking and it is very disturbing. The fit is just okay but tiring for long use. Another disappointment is that its mic is not recognized by Windows or Zoom. The indicator tones are very confusing, it should have voice guidance. The reset instruction on the leaflet are mentioned differently in two places. Waste of money.",3.0 
321,Just okay.,"I bought them sometime back. They worked okay in the beginning, but soon I realised not good with battery backup. The right airdope always runs out of battery much sooner than the left one. Looks faultier. But by the time I realised, it was already past the warranty period. That’s really faulty on sellers terms.The sound quality is okay okay. Not for someone who is an audiophile. Noise cancellation is also average. The rubber pods fail to stick to ear holes and can suddenly pop out. So beware.Overall quality is average only. It’s cost should have been lesser. Something of lesser price can be bought if the quality and usability is to be compromised anyway. Or one should rather add a little more money and buy something worth.PS: I use it with iPhone Xs. For daily usage like online classes it’s just working fine. But again, as there is an issue of slippery,non frictional, non vaccum rubber pod, it tends to pop out. When you adjust it, you mostly end up disconnecting your call. Irritating.",3.0

I find the fit rather comfortable as well - took me a day or two to figure out how to wear it properly so it doesnt fall out, but once I got past that, I have had no trouble (you gotta twist it around a little after putting it in).

Only difference is in their charging case, which is of 500mAh in airdopes 441 and 2600mAh in airdopes 441 pro.Go for the pro version only if you get it for 2500 else as airdopes 441 costs only 1999 with no major differences.Pros -Good bass and balanced audio between 65-75% volume.Extra sensitive touch controls.Very good passive noise cancellation.Good calling quality.Cons -It hurts sometimes because of the fin shaped rubber (I dont know if the problem is with everyone because fitting is different for everyone as everyone's ears are of different shape)Sometime when watching youtube videos, the left earbud produces static noise and the right one gives the video sound. It only happened with old youtube videos, on watching recent videos I didn't came across this issue.Vocals are on little low side when listening below 60%Final verdict - If you're looking for any good TWS under 5k then nothing is better than airdopes 441 and 441 pro.Go for it without any second thoughts.",5.0 
332,Value for money,"On the positive side, Guess this is the only ear pod with type c charger in this price band. On the negative side, too much bass which makes your ears tired soon. It fits pretty well on my ears and overall performance is really superb for this price. The Capacitive Touch is too sensitive, it took couple for me to get used to, especially when you try to wear while answering a call. There are two problems i faced (i) few second lag in connection as soon as you answer a call but stabilizes after that. (ii) often the right earbud volume level goes too low and have to factory reset to normalize.  Otherwise, i really low this product",4.0 
333,what about its lifespan?,tws is goood but ----its not waterproof..fake company claim.. duality in wordseveryone cares about sound quality bass...etc...but if any tws has weak lifespan then simply it does not worth it...because remember once its battery is dead its nothing but pebbleso im a regular person who invested 3k in a earphone...i will give my ultimate review atleast 1.5 years laterit is working fine till today...lets see about future days,4.0 
334,One must have if you are looking for Budget earpods,Boat Airdopes 441It's a true wireless earphones at price range of 2.5 k under this segment there are some competetors which are not so good .Boat  is the company known for its crystal clear sound I have been using Boat rockers for almost 1.5 years so I tried to switch on this segment.So here are pros and cons about the product .Pros:1.The built quality is extremely good2. The sound output is as expected and has deep base and high tones and low tones can be addressed easily3. The carrying case is good and has mangetic holding capability so it enaures true safety and prevents from falling airdopes .4. On an average it gives backup of 25+ hours and each dopes given you utmost 4.5 hours of battery backup once charge .5. It takes 45 min to get compeletely charge6.CTC works well and has hapetic feedback.7. Asthetically it looks good and premium also ergonomically designed for good comfort.8. It doesn't fall while you are running or gyming9.Call quality is good10.It feels good to see the utility and ease to carry your earphonesCons:1. The in ear rings can cause pain in your ear if you wear for long time .2. noise cancellation is good but not best .3. You cannot control volume on this .,5.0 
335,Pretty Decent and neat TWS headphones under 3k catagory.,"At this cost (2.5k) its quite decent bluetooth headphones. The bass is not that deep but quite impactfull. The lows and mids are impressive, the volume is low Unless you manually increase it from your device. The case is made of average plastic and holds up well. The battery life is brilliant and as they claim you can actually charge your phone with it if it's an emergency. Overall a decent product from Boat. If you are looking for a bwtger sound quality then I would recommend to increase budget and go for a JBL or sony, but if you are looking for TWS headphones under 3k this one does its job. Cheers",4.0 
336,Best customer service I have seen by any Indian company,"I like the pod's sound overall but it is a bit bass-heavy for me (I am a mixing engineer so I guess I'm just used to flat response headphones). I love the noise cancellation when I'm listening to audiobooks or just sitting in for a writing session. For me, I was surprised by their customer care. The pods stopped working after 15 days, I thought there goes my money down the drain. BoaAt customer care was excellent best service I have ever had from an Indian electronics company hands down.",5.0 
337,"Great headphones ,could have been better in noice cancellation","Sound quality and bass quality is really good. Of course its boat and you can't deny it. Comes with type-c charging port which is really awesome. Compact and duration of the headphones is realy good. I can use upto 3-4 hrsBut I'm really disappointed with the noise cancellation.It's pathetic.ppl on the other sided can even the voice of the vehicle going in the road, if I'm sitting inside my house. It could have been better.",3.0 
338,Fall in love with these when you open the case!!,"Just what is needed for the price, I was lucky enough to get it with a lightening deal.The audio clarity is excellent. The playback hours are really good. I could wear them for a long time without any ear pain or irritation. One wierd thing is that one of the ear buds loses power quicker than others, i guess that's because it's the primary. But recharges quickly and you are back on. So far the best ear buds for the price. Really worth it.",5.0 
339,Nothing great,"The way the bus penetrate in the ears will leave you in pain after sometime..you cannot wear it for a longer time .. the ear starts paining, moreover on wearing it you cannot hear anything from outside which makes it very dangerous  - you kind a get a continuous hollow noise in your ears, so even while talking to someone normally in person, your voices echoes to yourself... had worn it for the 1st week, now have kept it aside, can be helpful only during driving for a while.Ps - the opposite person doesn't hears our voice comfortably, so you end up speaking loudly.. buy ultimately that's what you can expect for its price",3.0

341,Great Audio but less battery backup!,"I have been using it for 5-6 months:Important Points:1) Quality bass for an airpod with really good lows! I really enjoyed every beat.2) Although looks bulky, fits into the ear like a charm. Doesn't fall off unless you hit your ear! Strong plastic build.3) Connectivity is really nice. Happens without a delay.4) LEDs are too attention drawing. Expected some way to control them but there ain't any!5) Battery back up was really good at the beginning but gradually dropped over time. After 5 months, 3.5 hour backup reduced to 30 min.- I have applied for warranty, lets see. Imagine Marketing has a very bad reputation for warranty claims (even their customer care isn't reachable). I had a very bad experience with them last time with my Rockerz 255! I will go up to 4 or 5 stars if they replace my unit!",2.0

The touch pad doesn't work.. buds doesn't get connected with Bluetooth automatically.. and while connecting it shows error most of the times..I bought this product because I have bought the same airdopes last year and it came out perfect..But I guess this ""masaba"" edition has this problem that I am facing..If you want to buy the boat airdopes I would suggest you to go for the original one and not for such colour themed edition, because it gives you various vibrant designs to choose but the quality is not up to the mark.. simple ones are good.",3.0

347,Honest review after one day of use.,Today I received and writing this review after one day of use.. 1st of all these buds are looking gud and very light weight. Also 3different size of free earmuff to suit your size.good points with these buds are-1. Good looking and very light weight2. Decent sound quality with gr8 bass3. Water resistance.4. Gr8 battery life of around 5-6 hrs and superb fast charging.5. Pairing is just fantastic and ultra fast.6. Not used outdoor but voice quality is decent while on call in indoor.Bad-1. Design can be improve more for better comfort and for heavy users.2. Not at all meant for gaming u can't play games whole using these. Worst gaming experience.3.bass is gud but need to improve for vocal sound and for musical instrument sound.4. Sometime Google assistance not works after lots of try then u need to put these in case and pair again. Alexa works just as charm.So overall gud experience with little issue that may solve later.  Gr8 deal if u buy these on some sale/discount in less than 1900rs,3.0

354,VALUE FOR MONEY,"1. NEVER EXPECT to be bassy and punchy like your usual wired headphones. I've been using realme buds2 and i did expect the same level in these ear buds and that's my fault. 🤷‍♂️2. WHICH DOESN'T MEAN these ear buds are useless, i got it for 2000 rupees and its VALUE FOR MONEY. 👌3. Primarily i bought it for gym purposes, but because am super fortunate, my gym closed due to covid contamination  the next day I received my parcel. Although i tested it for balance in ears, BALANCE DEPENDS ON EAR LOBE DESIGN. 👂4. My ear canal is kind of small, so i tried the smallest bud which got through the parcel, and still no proper fitness. Rough and rash head moves could easliy slips out the buds from ears; especially jogging.😒5. But i found out another way to feel the awesomeness of the buds. ON BIKE RIDES❤️6.🚫🚫CAUTION: WHILE WEARING BUDS UNDER HELMET YOU'll TOTALLY FEEL (like about 80%) NOISE CANCELLATION. SO BE CAREFUL WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND DRIVE🚫🚫.7. As the buds are a LITTLE BIG IN SIZE AND WEIGHT, bike riding was the only moment when can i properly utilize the buds, especially when it gets tightened by helmet. Absolutely sure you'll also sing through the song and good thing we are wearing masks.8. Buds HAS its bass thump. 4 OUT OF 5. You can't put the volume full, cause SOUND QUALITY CAN BECOME LOUD SOMETIMES, and i believe it can damage the ear drums to some extent. 👆9. The box is good.  Battery backup is good, Magnetism works well but be careful while opening the box, too much pressure can break the hinge and i don't even want to know if something happens like that🔚10. Love the thing🥰🥰",5.0 
355,Bang for the buck!,"Writing the review after two weeks of usage.Opted for boat airdopes 441 after a lot of scrutiny and comparison. On paper this is one of the best airpods for the price. Bang for the buck. Glad to say that it didn't disappoint one bit. The sound quality is too good. All notes are clear. The bass at times are too high but most of the times it’s perfect. Not as good as JBL but again keeping the price in mind, it’s worth it. One thing that shocked me was the treble these dopes provided. Absolutely sickening. Imo these are in par with the expensive airpods out there in terms of the treble. They have passive noise canceling and it’s pretty good.Talking about the fit now; I’ve worn a lot of earphones, from samsung to one plus to apple. All of them fit good. But this? This fit perfectly. Exact tightness. If you don’t like the ear pads, boat has provided a couple other sizes too. One of them ought to fit you. These snuggle up so well in my ears that even heavy movement running drills and jump rope fail to trip them out. Absolutely loved it. They’re IP67 rated so sweat us no issue.Now the connectivity; So far everything’s been smooth. I use an iOS. After initial connection it pairs up automatically every time you open and clip it in your ear. IWP.Battery; Battery backup so far is almost what they say on paper. A total of 30 hours playback time. Haven’t tested it for 30 but I’ve used it for long enough. It’s safe to say that it’ll get you through a day usage with one charge cycle.Call; I won’t suggest call on mono mode (only one airdope). But when both are clipped in your ear there’s no trouble and it’s pretty clear. Also a big no to using it for calling purposes in noisy environments.The only problem with these are regarding the capacitive touch. Don’t get me wrong it works fabulously. It’s just that it is way too sensitive. The slightest touch can work the functions. And sometimes I’ve noticed that when my sweat touches it too. But that’s definitely not a very troubling point. Just put it out here.All in all if you’re looking for a good budget wireless earphones with good sound quality and minimal flaws, then the boat 441 is the go to. Hope I helped you decide. Whether to buy or not.",4.0

Volume adjustmants could have provided with long pressOverall, first of all big thanks to big 2600mah case,Excellent airdopes in this budget.Single pod usage also there , who want to use continuesly for the day without charging case can use one bud at a time so that other will be in 100% charging when the first one was drying.Also , we can switch off the buds when not necessary which was not available in competitors.Good bass.. good sound quality.I like it till now. Will update after 10days usage",5.0 
358,Go for it without any hesitation. Perfect product💯,Its an awesome TWS device. Go for Boat Airdopes 441. I bought it for Rs. 2499. Today I recieved them and they are absolutely awesome. I called my friends and they told they were able to hear me clearly And need not mention I was perfectly able to hear them. The 6mm drivers are perfect and the songs sound quality is awesome. The bass is punchy. They are a perfect buy for a bass lover and someone looking for a budget friendly TWS. I was in doubt about calling feature reading other reviews but I have faced no issues as such.,5.0 
359,Not Worth at all. Calls keeps getting disconnected!!!,"This is a piece of crap. The earphones doesn't fits well and kept on falling no matter which buds you use, even with smallest buds, you get pain in your ears. All that was still fine, but the touch sensor is a bane instead of a boon. The touch sensor gets the call disconnected even if a strand of hair accidently touches it. Its frustrating to get official calls disconnected in the middle of some important discussion cz of the dumb touch sesor. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY TO BUY",1.0 
360,Decent option in this price range.,"Been using it for a month now ...Sound output is good for basic use - as in listening to music, watching videos and attending calls.There's almost no time lag in connecting to the phone.Range is around 15 - 20 feet indoors. Connection breaks if distance from device is more than this.I have charged the case just once after receiving the product. I use the dopes almost everyday for at least 2 hours. The indicator on the case still shows 50% charge.Build is sturdy.If the music has too much bass, it gets a little harsh on the ears. The buzz if the bass masks most of the other music, but this is only if played on full volume. So I feel it isn't a great choice for people into heavy metal, and even for those who listen to other loud music.Though made in China, Indian brand - another small factor I considered while buying.Overall, I'd say a decent option in said price range.",4.0 
361,YOU  SHOULD  BUY,I am using  this airdrops since  last 3 or 4 months  and it hasn't  showed me any problems.

Touch sensitivity is so good, just click n goCons:1. Noise cancellation is very poor, voice will not be clear when in public,you have to speak somewhat loudly else voice is not enough to other listener,if somebody talking besides you, that person voice catches easily, as earpiece mic is in ear.2.

One of them had low volume issues soon, and then it stopped charging properly in the case. Boat was nice enough to collect it from my home, took 3-4weeks to repair it and sent it back to me at no extra cost. So now I have repaired buds that still have charging issues from time to time. The sound is okay, but the pain in the ear is bad, and so is the mic quality.

It is as easy as open and pull out out the pods and just latch it on into the ears. Fits perfectly and does not fall off even on a sneeze :)The bluetooth reception is fairly good to about more than 10m. The voice quality on the mic and sounds in the pods are just amazing.

375,Most Honest Review of these Airdopes,"First all i would like to mention that it is a very good wireless earbuds @1999rs.When u put these airdopes in your ear for the first time u feel wierd because of whole covering the year for noise cancelation. But you get used it. Noise Cancellation also works pretty good. The Sound quality of these airdopes are good. And mind, These Earbuds have much extra bass compared to others. so for high bass lovers these are good. And if u dont like bass, dont go for it. Insta wake up and pair feature goes completeley good everytime. The touch controls are also good with high sensitivity. Charge also remains for good hours both with case and without. And If u buy these for only Gaming purpose, u feel a bit of latency which is common for all wireless earbuds. The Case is small and convenient. The earbuds get into the case smoothly with magnetic power most of times except a few times. I would suggest you this airdopes which are very good at the rate If u like extra bass and for music lovers. And if u are a big gamer who doesnt like even a bit of latency and if u dont like uch bass then u may go for other.",4.0

378,Good enough.,"Nothing fancy about these.Noise cancellation is alright. Used them while riding my bike and could faintly hear traffic noise. Not bad if you concentrate on listening music etc instead of traffic noise.Bass is a bit heavy considering you have to keep the volume of these above 60% for a good listen. Yeah you can't hear anything properly if you keep volume below 60% even in an noise free place.Battery life is a bit of a concern for me. barely lasts 3+ hours and somehow one earbud drained all of its battery while the other still had juice left, even though i charged them when i got them and never used only one of them separately.Case is good but i fear i might rip the top lid off cuz it feels very delicate for some reason. Has usb C so thats a plus.They maybe a pain if you listen to them for a while, i mean they fit good but you'll have to keep removing them for a minute or two to relive the pain once in a while. This obviously will vary person to person.Overall, as i said, they are good enough to be your first TWS earbuds. Go for it if 3k is your budget and you like bass.",4.0

380,3000 times worth it!!! Recommended for bass lovers!!!,"Review from 21 Dec 2020 (After 4 Months ) :I was skeptical in getting these earbuds but after a lot of comparing and watching a lot of YouTube videos, I finally got them and it exceeded my expectations. The main thing which I would like to highlight are its Bass and Battery life as they both are pretty amazing for its price of 2k. I hugely recommend these airdopes if you are a Bass head.The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement fold able pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.Okay now to its detailed pros and cons:-Sound Review 🔊 :- 4.8/51.Amazing Bass ( 100% for music Bass lovers). The bass is literally amazing. 100% RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE A BASS HEAD OR A MUSIC LOVER!!!2.True Wireless Stereo (TWS) works as expected connection time in matter of 1 second.3.At the initial pair it is set to 100% volume but in the next TWS it will recognize the previous setting and adjust.4.Sweet spot of volume would be at 60 or 70 %. (FYI, I felt best bass is at 70% though and the next point will tell you why not to cross after 70% outside on the road)5.After 70% its literally impossible to hear anything around oneself even if someone is yelling at the user face to face. No joke!! As the bass and the volume increases and the noise cancellation is more affective.Battery review 🔋  :- 4.5/51.Earbuds without the case:- 5 to 6 hours2.Earbuds with Case:- 3 or 4 days max (As per my usual usage )3.The case charges from 0 to 100 in 1.5 hours and the Airdopes takes about an hour or less.4.The buds can be used 4-5 times a day.5.At 60% volume the buds can stay up to 5 hours max.6.At 90% or above volume the buds can stay up to 4.5 hours max.7.As it reaches 10% it starts notifying low battery.8.The case turns its indicator to purple if its below 10% or 20%.Case Body, Range, Lag/Latency etc. 🎮🎶📞 :- (Durability - 4.8/5)1.Works well in 10 meter radius as advertised provided that nothing is obstructing between the Airdopes and the device its connected to.2.The case is pretty strong. Even if its dropped down to the floor nothing can happen.[ NOTE:- The case has a magnetic lid and it can open up, depending upon the impact the buds can fall out of its magnetic hold inside the case and the itself. I can ensure that no damage occurred other than few scratches of over time use ]. So for that, overall Durability Test A+.3.The case lid also has a magnetic lid which is strong unless if u drop it more than half a meter.4.There was no lag at all while playing multiplayer games like Apex, CODM, COD Warfare, Star Wars Battlefront II, etc. Footsteps can be a little hard to hear but its fine honestly its little less audible than my Sennheiser CX 180 and its hard to notice as thats not much of a difference.5.Calling features works well with good clarity in a noiseless environment as there is any noise in the background the mic from the earbud will pick it up. Lets say it does its job.6.The buds have touch buttons for its media/call purposes respectively.  a)Single touch on either side to start playing song.  b)Double tab on right to skip to next song.  c)Double tab on left to previous song.  d)Long press for 2 seconds on either side for Assistant.  e)Long press more than 2 seconds on either side for turning off that particular side earbud.  f)Single tap to accept the call.  g)IF the call is going on then single tap again to cut the call.  h)Double tap to reject call.7.The capacitive touch is so sensitive that it works with watery hands, cloth touch, rubber, gloves etc.8.The ear hooks can take sometime to getting used to until you find the prefect fit it will keep coming out of the ear. So wear the correct rubber fittings and ear hooks which is for your ear.9.After long periods of usage (more than 6 hours) the buds can start coming lose as it loses its grip but this depends from person to person.10.Haven't tested the water drop test yet but its splash proof guaranteed and has IPx7 rating.11.I usually use them at night when I go to sleep and next day morning I may be sleeping on it and nothing happens to it.",5.0

383,The best in the budget !!!,"After using it for a month,I have the following observations:Pros1.Bass quality is very good and punchy.2.Battery life is good .It easily lasts for 4-5 hrs on single use.As for the case I need to charge it once in 7-8 days . Case is also sleek and acceptable size and fits into any trouser pocket easily.3. Connectivity is one of the biggest plus points.Its IWP function really works like a charm. There is absolutely no lag in connection once u take out the earbuds from the case4.Fit and comfortability is excellent..U can wear it for 2-3 hrs at a stretch without any discomfort or pain in ears. After that it might get a bit uncomfortable,but I guess that's the case with almost all the TWS earbuds available in the marketCons:1.Call quality is ok in quiet environment..but in crowded places it is very poor. I have to remove the earbuds and speak directly over the phone when I'm im travelling.2 .Noise cancellation is only passive,not active3. Sometimes one of the earbuds stops working when u remove it from your ear even for a few seconds.But the problem is immediately rectified when u put both the earbuds in the case,close it and take them out againOverall a good buy, considering the price range. I would recommend these earbuds for their decent sound quality,good battery life , and ultra fast connectivity.",4.0 
384,Good sound but not so good comfort.,"Well It's been 2 days since I've been using them and I would say these are a pretty decent pair of earbuds.Starting off with sound quality, it's amazing... while ordering them I thought since they have just 6mm drivers, there loudness might be low but that's not the case here. I compared them with OnePlus bullets and boat rockerz 255 pro and they beat OnePlus ones and stand at same level with rockerz. Bass is nice, trebles are good, overall 4.5/5 for sound.Connectivity- it's super fast. As soon as you open them they connect automatically to previously connected device in 1-3 seconds.Coming to comfort- I'm disappointed. They give such a strong grip that they started pain in my ears after 5-10 minutes of usage. I was not able to use them for even 30-40 minutes. Now the thing is everyone's ear size is different so I can't say how will they fit on you but for mine they are super tight in medium size and loose in large ones. After trying to diagnose the issue, I found out that the part in my ears where the wings of the buds fit to provide grip is not so big (i.e. my ears are not big enough though I'm 18) because of that they were paining a lot. So if you have small space above your ear canal then you will also feel the same issue like me. In the end had to return them, I felt bad as they sounded amazing but they were tight.Overall they have amazing sound quality but not so good comfort (at least for me) . If you are okay with it, you can go with them else look for something elseThank you !",4.0 
385,Only two stars,"One star for Build quality, One star for sound quality.Cons:1. Bluetooth connection with mobile is good, but for PC or Mac really bad. I need to change the Headset for call and Song each time.2. The touch sensitivity is too much, I can't adjust the ear buds without touching it. Either does a play/pause or connects call.3. Definitely not 150 hours charge backup. Also 5 hours charge for headphones is not working. I need to charge it between 2 to 3 hours gap.4. Bass seems over high.",2.0 
386,CUSTOMER - BE CAREFULL...READ BEFORE YOUR ACCEPT ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I opened the ordered parcel, the box was not sealed with polythene, sound quality and performance of the Airdopes were unsatisfactory. I carefully observed the box and found scratches on the Airdopes. Immediately I was convinced that used item was handed over to me. I rejected the same and replacement was sent by vendor. This time it was quite OK. It was sealed with polythene all around the box and on opening the box Airdopes and case was in good condition.Now, regarding the sound quality, it is satisfactory, the product is very good, but in lesser price range Real Me is offering Airdopes and its performance is nonetheless inferior to BoAt.",4.0 
387,"Build quality best Packaging 👍🏼,Sound ok too, there's a bit of Current discharge noise is it's👎🏿","Packaging as always best no room for complaint there , Build quality excellent too , feels premium , Sound quality need to be improved , there's  is a bit of faint  eletricaL shimmering disturbance that is bothersome at times for which I ordered a replacement which it was but defect still persists , so product needs a bit of refinement and at times you might be addressing slight of heating issue in  an airdopes , and  it takes time to get used to this design as it may cause discomfort to 👂& needs to be readjusted . Overall I am extremely satisfied with the back up it has , quick charging, robust build quality , areas that need to be upgraded is eleminate unnecessary noise generated due to discharge & demands more cushioning so that it doesn't render the ears aching.how ever after 8months of use one ear buds mic has malfunctioned now looking forward to get it repaired",2.0

397,Boat products and services are just going bad!,I ordered these about a month ago. At first I received used product from Amazon so had it replaced.Replacement earbuds lasted only for a month. Left earbud couldn't last for more than 20 minutes on full charge. I thought electronics do go bad and that is what warranty is for. So looked it up and they are making me cross almost an entire city and get these to their service center and then I have to do that again to get them back. If it were to have lasted at least for a 6 months then I wouldn't have mind but this is just too much.,1.0 
398,9 months review. Sharing an incident.,"Pros: Sound quality is good. Very bassy.  Battery life is amazing. Feels  premiumCons: After 10 days of use, noticed a slight crackle in the left earbud. So for instance, if you start some video and pause it, there's a significantly audible crackle in the left earbud which is kind of annoyingUpdate (9 months use) : Okay I may have nitpicked in the cons. But these earphones are durable too. I accidentally dropped these in water and sound and bass were gone. Which made me buy realme air buds 2 which has advanced features like ANC and a dedicated software. Suddenly, my airdopes started working. Realme isn't bad but I did not like the transition from airdopes so much. The overall sound quality is so much satisfying on airdopes. I am a bass lover, and these provides authentic bass as compared to a bass boosted mode on the realme, which overshadows other aspects of the song you're listening to. So, I'll say you'll have your money well spent on airdopes. It's cheaper and after all, the sound quality matters.",5.0 
399,Given false description on the the display page.,"Although Airdopes are good, But amazon did false advertising / given false description of the product (like showed ipx7, 25 hours backup etc. but the real configuration was 18 hrs, ipx6) in display page.

One of the charging buds dint work an so the earbuds isn’t charge at all. Always says power low even after keeping in charge for long time.

402,Boat Airpodes 441 Pro - Blast with Sound,"I bought this product during the Prime day launch. .Got this product after reviewing and seeing its older version on youtube. It is fantastic product and it is my first TWS and its working good in my Iphone 11 with siri with a tap.The size of airbud flawlessly goes into your ears and perfect for home gym workouts.I chose red product. Since, i own Iphone 11 red.  Its sounds and noise cancellation are awesome.I am posting this review after 2 days usage. Backup and Case with inbuilt Powerbank of 2600 mah with the price.Only thing , which is missing is wireless charging. If they gave it next edition in boAt airpodes that would be great.",4.0 
403,Best TWS for the price !,"I bought this in Prime Day sale and honestly speaking this is one of the best deals ever.Sound quality is awesome. Bass is so good that I don't hesitate comparing it with Bose TWS that costs around 18k.People going around saying that it doesn't have noise cancellation. Well yes you can say it doesn't cancel out the noise when you're talking to someone on calls and the other person can hear your background noise on the other side of the call (but that thing is acceptable because it happens in the case of bare naked phones too)but when you are listening to songs, I must tell you it doesn't let you hear whatever is going on the outside. Moreover, when you put on these buds, it already cancels out 50% of the noise whatever is going on around you.It has a massive battery backup (yeah that's why they're taking 1k more than the normal version)The only shortcoming I found was, in low volume (less than 40% vol) the songs feel empty(I mean it doesn't give much bass and the treble is also low, the sound is flat) but hey who's gonna keep the volume low, right? Turn it up to 60% and there you go! feel the nirvana !",5.0 
404,Call? No. Only music?

405,Great deal at this price.,"Excellent quality and build,t hose who complain.....what else do you expect at this price....a carbon fibre case!!!Overall nice build, ofcourse the bass is low and the volume also seems a bit less in comparision with around the neck or over the ear headphones......for watching video lectures and stuff....this is the best....calling quality is acceptable unless you talk for hours in a day.",5.0 
406,Satisfied.,"Only been a day since I bought. Will be updating it after further use.I've added pictures to show the different sizes of buds packed along with it (as well a pair of fins of slightly different shape).Once I got the right buds fitted to them they are conformable to wear, even for long durations and they do not pop out either. I even went cycling for a few km, the buds held.Pros:4 sets of silicone tips and 2 pairs of fins provided in total.ComfortableGood fitIWP (instant wake n pair, the buds connect to the last connected device as soon as the lid is raised)Capacitive touch (pause/play, next/prev, accept/reject calls, Google assistant/siri)They look cool.BASS- OK the bass is really good. Also my phone has built in audio enhancement by Dolby, that makes it even better. Best this price can give you.Mono/stereo- u can use 1 bud at a time too. Noise cancellation: with the right tip, the ear is completely plugged.ConsCalls- the person u r speaking to, will hear a lot of your background noise. If using for calling purposes, try to avoid sitting under a fan and stay indoors.Internal noise-not exactly a con. This is a problem with every noise cancelling earphones / IEMs. With external noise subdued, internal sounds like blood rushing and footsteps are enhanced. You will get used to it.Volume controls - volume can't be controlled.Connectivity-claims to be BT v 5.0 but cannot connect to multiple devices at once.Also, you can't change the track being played only if one bud is connected.If I face any issues, I'll update.",4.0 
407,Genuine review.Decent buy.,"Writting review after 15days. I am just going to mention what I liked and disliked here.Liked-1.Battery backup is really good. Goes till 10 hours with 100%.2. The sound quality is great,you really get good experience while binge watching.3. Handsdown on noice cancellation. Better than any other pods.Disliked-1. Connectivity issue. While watching sometime bluetooth gets disconnected automatically. And one of the pods doesn't gets paired at times. Which i find very annoying.2. Its bit painful in the ear after wearing for longer time.But overall I think its a decent buy for those who wants to experience pods. And wants to invest money in something good.",4.0 
408,Don't BUY this unless you READ the REVIEW,"Pros1. Better Sound Quality2. Good enough Bass3. TWS (True Wireless Stereo) with IWP (Insta Wake and Pair) works fine4. IPX7Cons1. No ANC - Active Noise Cancellation2. It's a pain in the EAR (personal experience)3. Sometimes only one earbud gets paired, so you need to put them back in the box and open again (typical Indian booting concept 😄)4. You don't get any RETURN option from Amazon, although you get a REPLACEMENT option but the window is open for only 7-10 days from the date of purchaseSo what should you do then?1. Choose the brand wisely2. If you like boAt (like ME😜), then go for 281 in the same price range3. Choose the shape of your earbuds carefully4. If TWS doesn't matter to you, then go for OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition which is a in-Ear Bluetooth Earphone5. If Bluetooth doesn't matter to you then go either for JBL C200SI or boAt BassHeads 225/100",3.0 
409,"At this price point, buy it","You must know what you want and what you get at this price... it's not the best sound quality, obviously. But do you need that? If you do, take a gamble, spend 10k online and buy a branded pair. But if your use is just listening to music (like ordinary people, rather than going on and on about bass and high notes and God knows what), listening to podcasts or audio books, think no further, buy it. There is that hum in one of the buds, not constantly but it's there. This has been very useful for me and I'd recommend it to anyone.",4.0 
410,Good product,"Work as expected. Easy pairing, C type charger, single device at a time connectivity, good bass, no volume control, sound quality good at 70% range, no noise cancelation, music pause, resume and next works fine with touch. Overall good product in this price range.",5.0

Can’t imagine how the connection could become so weak with such little obstruction!One side stopped working after 3 weeks.The touch input zone or the lighting is not useful. There is no feedback against any tap on the unit.Utter waste of money. All boat TWS have disappointed so far.Boat makes the best neckbands, but they should give up making these tws.",1.0 
412,As Worthy as Captain America 👍,"Awesome sound quality, highly recommend for bass lovers, instant connectivity. I'm using them with Samsung M30s and I'm having no lagging or delay during games.

414,Your ears will hurt,"I enjoy listening both to music and podcasts, and as such, I keep listening to things throughout the day. And it's not that these earphones are bad from the perspective of sound quality.But, their size is such that it will hurt people because of it's unevenly distributed weight, regardless of what tips you use. The bulk at the back really adds to the pressure. The other issue is that it does not work well on flights at all. Hardly any passive noise blocking, forget cancellation.Overall, it's a fairly priced product and decent quality as well. But if your ear canal is small, the distributed weight issue will affect you.",3.0 
415,"Good sound, poor connectivity","As good as the sound quality is, the connectivity is abysmal. Simply turning your head while using the headphones causes an instant disconnection. I've tried this on multiple devices (not only phones but tablets, desktops and laptops).Notice cancellation is virtually non-existent. It's noise isolation, of course and that itself isn't great.The mic doesn't work anymore. Don't know when it stopped but it definitely worked when I first got the earphones.I'd give the product 4 stars for sound quality. 1 star for build quality. 0 for connectivity.",2.0 
416,Comfortable ear buds with poor audio quality,"Using it from 2 months. The ear buds are comfortable to wear and are light weight.But there are 3 major issues with the ear buds.1. Frequently gets disconnected.2. Audio is not loud and clear.3. Some times one of the buds don't get charged properly (in my case left ear buds has charging issue)This ear buds have excellent battery backup and are very much comfortable if you use it for longer duration.I use it for my morning walks, the audio is not that great and the volume is low when compared to mivi and redmi(under 2.5k-3k).",3.0 
417,"Great sound, Hassle free High quality product","I have been using this air dopes 441 for the last 6 months. I have had my doubts about how it would work and the quality of the sound. These headphones totally surprised me. Sound quality is great. Bass is great. Noise cancellation is good. One big advantage is it being wireless so that we can move about doing our things. One con is that while on calls the other person would hear more of our surroundings, so it cannot be used to take calls in noisy environment. On the whole am really about the purchase as none of the wired headphones lasted for me for more than 6 months",5.0 
418,Case doesnt have good battery but product is overall good,"The product is ok. Overall good noise cancellation but only issue is connectivity. Sometimes only 1 side works. I had to factory reset it to get both dopes working again. Sound is ok but bass sometimes mask the voice. Overall fine product. The power bank capability of case is useless as it can just juice up the phone to 15% on full charge. And 150 hrs claim is useless. The case can charge airdopes only 5 to 6 times i.e., 25 to 30hrs. I suggest going for basic airdopes 441 and not pro.",4.0 
419,Value for Money,"In these times of WFH, having a decent pair of TWS earphones is more of a necessity rather than a desire. These earphones are a bang for the buck. I'll divide my review in pros and cons and my experience with the 441 Pro after about a month of use. My review will only be based on the Indoor Usage of these earphones as I am too afraid to use TWS earphones while an outdoor workout or otherwise.Note:- The only difference between the Boat Airdopes 441 and Airdopes 441 Pro is the battery capacity of the charging case. The former comes with a 500 mAh battery while the latter comes with a 2600 mAh battery capacity.Pros:-1. These offer a very balanced sound.2. They have a good amount of bass which is not overpowering and if you use an equaliser you can boost the bass even further but that is not recommended as it overpowers the highs and the midtones.3. They have very good passive noice cancellation. A person will literally have to stand on your head and shout his lungs out for you to be able to hear him.4. The earphones have a battery life of about 5 hours without the charging case.5. The charging case comes with a 2600mAh battery which also doubles as a powerbank. In my month of usage I have charged the case only twice till now and that is when I use the airdopes on a daily basis.6. Has USB type C charging with a charging cable bundled inside the box. You also get two extra silicone eartips for varrying ear sizes.7. The case supports Fast Charging8. The airdopes have a capacitive touch that is surrounded by a ring of led lights which glow in different colors depending on the function they are performing.9. The earphones are very light weight and have an official IP X7 rating making them swearlt proof which means they can be used in the gym or while outdoor workouts though I have not used these for that very purpose.10. The earphones are magnetically held inside the case which provides a secure position to them.11. You can perform many functions with the earphones like pick up or end calls, play/pause music, use voice assistants etc.Cons:-1. The charging case is big and feels heavy when compared to something like the case of Apple Airpods. This might be because of that huge 2600 mAh battery that the case has.2. If you are a sort od person who likes to fit your tws charging case in your coin pocket then this is not for you. It just doesn't fit inside the coin pocket of jeans and you'll need to keep it inside the phone pocket or the wallet pocket because it is a big case and takes up quite a bit of real estate.3. The lid of the charging case doesn't open up sufficiently for one to take out the earphones comfortably. The lid opens at a 90 degree angle which is not sufficient enough given the stability of the lid is low. It has happend many times with me that while taking out the earphones my finger just slightly touches the case lid and it comes crashing down.4. The rubber rings around the earphones that are provided for a secure fit in the ear start causing pain after about an hour or half of use and then you have to remove the earphones. However the good side is that these rings are removable.5. The overall ergonomics of the case and the earphones need a bit of rework for a more user friendly experience.Overall, I'd say if you are a bass head and dont want to burn a hole in your pocket then go for these earphones or even Boat Airdopes 441.Hope my review helps you make an informed decision while making a purchase.",4.0 
420,Awesome earbuds but not for gamers,"General- The airdopes come with a very sensitive touch control panel. A little bit too sensitive but it is also the best touch control in this price range and so is the connectivity.Battery - The battery backup is really good just like it is shown. The eardopes and the charging case charge relatively fast. So if you are looking for battery and can't afford the pro version, go for the base version without any doubt.Sound quality - The sound quality is really nice even with the 6mm drivers the bass and the loudness are perfectly matched for me as I am a bass lover but if you are not one then the bass might be a bit muchLatency - If you are a gamer and want it for gaming then I don't reccomend buying this one or any Bluetooth earbuds. You should rather buy a wired headphone but if you really need a Bluetooth earbud in budget then I recommend the realme buds q as it has a larger driver size, lower price and lower latency",5.0 
421,Good one! Go for it,"I purchased by January 8Two or three days back the charge was dropped to Single light out of four. I'm trying to say the battery backup is really really great.Water resistant ✔️Sound quality ✔️Issues I faced :Slightly it gets disconnected and connects automatically,It's light weight but after continuous and long hours of usage i felt heavy on ears. It's natural but I have to mention it.Credits to:Perfect fit in ears,Audio clarity while speaking in calls,Looks good!",5.0

HAHAHA!4 sweatproof5 playtime is good6 supports voice assistance that's amazing.7 easy to charge and operate8 charging case comes with a magnet so earbuds fit in easily in the case.Cons:1 Either there is a problem with my ears or these earbuds are not exactly designed for use while workout, I always felt like it may fall down if I keep running.2 Deep bass is good  but not that good , if I have to rate the bass quality I would give 3 out of 53 noise cancellation is good but not so great. definitely not bad for this price range, 3 out of 5 for that too.",5.0 
423,Worth the money.,"For the price, these are a good set of earbuds. I mainly use them while working out. It has a good fit and haven’t faced any connection issues till now. Battery life is also good, though I haven’t exactly measured it. One improvement I can suggest is to improve the build quality of the hinge mechanism for the charging case.",5.0 
424,Best product at best price - Boat,"Brought this product at offer price. I like this because 1) It's  Boat, 2) Low price 3) Awesome sound 4) Instant connect 5) Highly sensitive touch 6) compact 7) No pain can wear till the battery lasts 8) No headache .. can use for hours, Around 3 Hrs play.  It does not stop wen u remove any side while playing; it continues to play untill u keep it in the charging deck or case. No volume but u can't expect at low price Buds even AirPods does hve that facility.  Value for money.",5.0 
425,No proper service.,My Right Pod discharges very fast. Used only for 20mints. Update: Sent Airdopes for service. The service was delayed. There was no communication from their end. I had to call customer service for more then 5 times to talk to customer service personnel. They said they r sending a replaced product. Once I got the product. My right one is working fine the left side isn't charging at all. I understand the delay is bcoz of Covid but my problem is not solved yet. Now can't get hold of customer service personnel to even register my complaint.,1.0

428,Okay. Detailed review.,"Sound quality: I have wired proton earphone as well. That was 700 rupees earphone and the sound quality was just amazing. Here, boAt airdropes is good in terms of sound quality but pales in terms of comparison.Call quality: Poor. The other person will feel like the phone is on speaker mode with all surrounding sounds.Noise cancelling: Well, it doesn't have active noise cancelling feature but I was okay with it as I couldn't hear any external sounds at 60% and above volume.Fit and build quality: This is where it is paisavasool. Perfectly fit and the earbuds won't fall off. Build quality is good too.Any issue:  Yes, sometimes the left ear bud stops responding which is too irritating. Then, you have to put it in case again and reconnect.Bass: Optimum.Treble: GoodTouch response: goodLagging: No lagging unless you are playing games.Auto off: It doesn't switch off automatically if you remove it from ears. You have to long press it or you have to put it in case to switch them off.Service: Not availed yet. So, I can't comment.",3.0

430,Best under 2000,Bought this product a week ago during republic day offer. This is the first time I'm using TWS buds. That's why I searched alot for these like which one should to buy and what are their pros over wired ones. So at last I chose this one over realme buds q and some of the noise products and many others too. So I have done my home work and it was really time taking like watching abound videos on YouTube and gone through different sites to search for the best. So i can assure you that this is the best quality earbuds in terms of everything but below 2000 price list. Because I've done the research after limiting my budget 🙃.  Thank you.,5.0 
431,Killer product 🔥🔥,Amazing product. Currently I'm using realme buds wireless. This is my first tws earbuds. These are the best tws earbuds under 2k. Fits perfectly in my ears. Sound quality is amazing. Bass is just dope🔥🔥. If you are a bass lover definitely this is for you. Build quality is also great. Connectivity is seamless whenever you open the lid it's connect within a seconds.  Passive noise cancellation work pretty well. Instant wake pair function is cherry on cake. Feels premium in hand. And looks is killer and everyone notice due to its RGB lights. Touch sensitivity is excellent. Call quality is good for indoors and but average for outdoors. If you are in a crowded area next person will getting some background noise but that's okay. Consider this price it's negligible.  No volume control. If you are confused between Boat airdopes 441 and Boat airdopes 381. Definitely bought 441. I bought it in lightning deal in 2k. So I would suggest you to buy this in lightning deal.Delivered in one day. 🔥🔥😎🤟🏻,5.0 
432,Terrible Headphones for Phone Conversations,"The first pair of headphones I received I had to I replace as the people on the other end complained that they could barely hear me.After I received the replacement, the problem persists.On top of that the capacitive touch panels are terribly sensitive, the slightest touch disconnects an ongoing call.Would not recommend if you plan to use for calls. Okayish for music.",1.0 
433,Sound Reception Issue,"These earbuds are ofcourse really good for having massive experience of listening music, watching movies and playing games. But when comes to calling, these earbuds experience issue in receiving sound through mic. I have experienced this many times that the sound is not audible to my most callers and they always complain me that my voice is not loud and helplessly I have to switch to phone mic then.",5.0 
434,Great product at affordable price,"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bass.I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 7-9 days. and for this price range, these earphones make a great choice. I've known boat for pretty good sound quality and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever. The fit is amazing, and they just don't come off no matter how much I try to shake them off.",5.0 
435,Read the review🤣,"So, for people who are thinking of buying these earbuds I would say go for it. Because all that really matters is connectivity and sound quality, for which I think it’s good. The insta pairing works very well for me and the sound quality is also great. The battery life is ok I guess, it’s just 3 hours ( it’s fine for me ). It also has touch controls which makes it easier to use by just touching, unlike the AirPods Pro which requires squeezing, so that’s a good thing. So if you’re a budget minded person who needs the quick pairing feature and good sound quality, I think it’s safe to say JUST BUY IT ( instead of JUST DO IT )",4.0 
436,Nice pair of TWS,"I find them really nice. I basically use them to connect to my smart TV and my personal laptop to listen to songs and for entertainment. The sound quality is great. But my ears get itchy after a few minutes and I have to scratch my one ear or the other randomly, but this may be due to my ears, so will not comment further on this. I have not tried the noise cancellation on this, but yes, I spoke to my wife over the phone using these TWS, and my wife could hear me find without any background noise. Noise cancellation will be best tested when on a client call, and I use a separate headset dedicated for that, since my office system does not have Bluetooth connectivity available. Overall, the experience is good.",4.0 
437,Perfect 👌,"First of all these buds fits in your ears perfectly and you won't feel any pain and these are lightweight and small in size compared to others.The ""SOUND"" Quality is the best in this range and bass is so gooood. But only you need to play HD music (128bit/320bit) to feel real magical sound.AND Call quality is superb and clear.You can use 4- 4.5 hrs for single full charge and no connectivity issuesThank you boat.",5.0 
438,Everything that you can expect,"Sound quality: 5/5 Crisp and clearBass: 5/5 punchy bassNoise Cancellation: 4/5 passive noise cancellation and unlike active noise cancelation headsets, you can slightly hear outside noise especially on lower volumePrice: it's well worth at 2,000 rupeesLooks: fabulous, box and earbuds are sturdy. Great finish.Comfort: 4/5 sits nicely in ear. Doesn't fall off. Prolonged use for few hours might get inconvenient.Verdict: Go for it.Comparision: I bought Boult airbass propads along with Boat airdopes 441. Both are great but I found boat 441 slightly better. But I still kept both.",5.0 
439,Excellent Amazon. Worst BoAt EarDopes,"I am not happy with the product.First of all, it is not unique product for everyone. I got ear pain after some time as it is ""IN THE EAR"" type. So I cannot use it for continuously.Worst part is connectivity. As it is mentioned, each bud cannot be used to tow different phones at the same time. I am unable to use one bud for one phone and the other bud to another phone. When I bought 1st one, worked for 3 days and again stopped and I am unable to vonnect to my phone OPPO F15.I asked for replace which I got. Thanks to Amazon service. But 2nd product also not convenient..So I returned it completely and I got refund on the same day.Sound quality is not good.Base is not up to mark.Not at all recommended.",3.0 
440,love them,i really like the product sound quality is good and its look stylish too. The only thing that I find negative about is that when ever i'm on call or listening yo music if i accidentally touch the sensing area the call will cut and music will stop. I wish it had double touch system to close the call and stop the music but aside from the every thing is good.(note-I have long hair and even they touch the sensing area i face the problem that i mention above so make sure to tie you hair carefully and be cautious of your hand when you use them)about rest its great,4.0 
441,Good for music but bad for calls,"I got these ear phones looking at all specs and colours. I have used wireless but They were my first earbuds , and after using them I realised what I should have checked into more. These are good for music but two important drawbacks are that the noise cancellation is bad so if you are outside, travelling or in a public place ,you won’t be able to talk on phone with these. With mask in Covid times it becomes more difficult. You have to speak really loud for the other person to hear something and without mask. Second aspect is that they are bulky and heavy, so they tend to fall off easily from your ears, making it difficult to wear them while running and they also make your earlobes ache. So overall not a good choice so be careful if it’s your first time!",3.0 
442,Honest Review,Always used BOAT and Loved it. Here is my honest review :1. Comfortable - 4 Star ( May be little uncomfortable for 1-2 days  - I did not feel anything). It's very light weighted you can use all day.2. Audio - 3 Star (With this range it could be better ). Audio is great for listening music but could be better according to price.3. Noise Cancellation - 4 Star ( You will be not disturbed with any noise while listening to songs). Ofcourse it doesn't stop 100% noise but it's acceptable and very nice.4. Battery - 4 Star (7 to 8 Hours without use of Battery Case )5. Touch - 5 Star ( You have to make little habit but this makes the Airdopes so much cool and works just awesome).Overall I think this product is nice and there is nothing negative till now ( I am using since last 10 days). But it could be cheaper or if not then it can be little more better according to it's price. I am satisfied with this one tho.,3.0 
443,AIRDOPES ARE DOPE,"I have used these Boat airdopes 441 pro for 1month now, It has powerful bass punchy bass (car subwoofer wali), Sound clarity is too good, you cannot even hear anything what's happening around (club vali feel dete hai). It looks good for gym freak also they don't need to put those massive headphones (same sound quality you get, without any wires and sweat that we get after wearing headphones for a long time). Its just OP surely upgrade yourself to NIRVANA.",5.0

This time your nailed it when it comes to balanced sound and comfort.Just a little equliisation on your phone software would enhance the quality of sound on these ear buds.Batery life and noise cancellation could have been better, otherwise worth 1,999 and can be compared with brands like samsung /blaupunkt /etcGo for it all you music lovers.",5.0

Premium look.3. Long lasting battery and gets quickly charged.4. TWS ia absolutely fantastic, if your Mobile's Bluetooth is on and you open the box , it will automatically get connected. If your music player has a setting of 'Play songs automatically as soon as Bluetooth is connected', you will be able to listen songs immediately.5. Provided extra buds for ear adjustments.6. LED indicators  on battery changes its colors depending on the % remaining7. Very light weight box and airpods.Cons:1. Very sensitive capacitive touch. You can't adjust the airdopes during the call , if they are touched even by Mistake, the call will get disconnected. Happened to me several times.2. No volume adjustment through touch. You will have to adjust via mobile phone/connected device. So if you are connected to TV via Bluetooth, the volume control through both remote and airdopes will not work3. The quality of the mic is not that great, next person complained that they are hearing low sound. Happened with different persons.4. Doesn't fit perfectly , there chances of falling down while exercising, happened with me.5. Box looks delicate, need to handle with care and save it from falling.6. IPX6, we should get IPX7 at this price level.Overall 3.5/5. Expected more from boat but overall okay. Make your choice accordingly.",3.0

473,worst experience with this product,at first the product was working ok but later the return period it was losing the power on one bud. and started giving 1 mins of time only then i claimed the warranty they picked up the product and nearly 25 days in transit and another week for replacement and still this product was not sended to me . i know its pandemic time its take time to do anything but here its seem to be like negligence. by the way the product has good sound and bass .,1.0 
474,Boathead forever,"So okay I am a person who doesn't know in depth about all these prerequisites like bass, treble or equaliser. I just gotcthem today and I am loving the sound. Voice quality on call is really good. I was a little worried to buy this and literally searched and compared it to jbl's other tws models and even boat's own models. I got a little help as it was the modified version of airdopes 441, which had so many youtube reviews. The day I bought it, there was no review or youtube video exactlyy about this product. But the fit is so perfect, I am loving it. My ear size is a little small and I wasn't sure whether I would be comfortable or not ! But to my surprise, it's really fulfilling. It's not my first boat product and it sure won't be my last . And I have ordered the sporty blue one , and thought it would be looking pretty bright royal blue as is in the picture above. But in reality, it's not that bright coloured. It's a decent blue one. Although I really don't know if the promised battery back up of 150+ hrs is true or not as I haven't used it more than 2 hours. But so far it's the best one that one can get for 2.5k",5.0 
475,Not worth dont buy,"Bought by seeing some good reviews but item is not up to the mark, though delivered on time but the product seemed to be of low grade, sound quality is poor, having issue in connecting TVs and other gadgets, then I returned my eardopes once in a hope that replaced item may work good. But to my surprise it was even worst than previous one as right EarPod becomes silent more often with no blinking light, charged so many times but no avail. Sometimes it will start working its own.. and again same connecting issue.Returning the product and requested for refund. You may look for other brand.",1.0 
476,Good budget Airdopes which helps people who does not have higher expectation.,"I liked this product it is a nice choice.First of all I bought this one @1999 on lightning deal, friends its actually worth for 1999 only.Someone looking for a Good Airdopes with touch sensor with less expectation this product will be good for you.Listening music is good (good quality of Bass) and you will get an Avarage call quality. Battery backup is really good as I m getting a better battery life as expected( using from last 1 month)When you touch for to play next or priovous songs or pause I feel some latency on this device. Getting a good connection as claimed 10 m as I tested from a opean ground which is a good feature.Overall anyone can go with this product who looks for a budget Airdopes without too much high expecations then without a second thought go for it. You will enjoy it",4.0 
477,"Pathetic product, please don’t buy, boAt has failed its loyal customers","This is a highly overrated product! I’m writing an honest review after one month of usage. Worst thing is that Amazon doesn’t allow return of this product and only replacement is allowed.Okay, so the design of the product is not at all user-friendly, it causes great discomfort and pain in the ear even after 20 minutes of usage. If this was not enough, it keeps falling out of the ear and you have to be careful while wearing them. Talking about the sound quality, it’s very, very average - just not worth the money. Bass quality too is really bad. Battery too drains out quickly and you have keep charging them repeatedly. Coming to the touch panels, too sensitive they are. Many times, if you’re getting a call and you have to quickly wear the two Airdopes, it’s highly likely that you will end up touching the touch panel and thus disconnecting the call. The entire thing is very inconvenient to use.Overall, very unpleasant experience with this product, please don’t buy, don’t fall for this worthless product.",1.0 
478,Minor buzzing noise,Everything's good including the case and buds. But one thing i can't help to notice is that i hear a minor buzzing sound iny left bud whenever i pause the music. I would be careful for that thing. Otherwise the product is good,3.0 
479,Not comfortable in the ear,"Got it yesterday.. these are the views of one day usage.Pros:- Big battery (2600mah) case makes it easy to handle the buds instead of charging it everyday.- Connects to my phone as soon as under 2 seconds of case opening.Cons:- Buds doesn't fit in ears correctly, I tried with all silicon ear pieces that they gave.- The silicon ear pieces provided are bit tougher than what I got for my other wired phones- There is no place to hold the earbuds without touching the captive touch sensor which is not convenient (we end up answering the call while keeping the first ear bud in the ear and ending the call while keeping the second one. Very bad design)- Earbuds battery level are not properly being displayed in the phone- Earbuds charge very quickly... Like in maybe 10-15 mins or so... Which is weird... I think they are not properly displaying the battery level.- Not comfortable in the ear, this button earbud design is hard to handle than the aripods design. Airpods just sit in the ear canal... These have to be pushed inside the ear canal and lock them for it to be properly be in the ear.- Sound is not that good.. I would say close to average quality... I feel good when I take them out of my ear.. you get my point with this sentance.Am planning to check for another day or so and see if I should keep them or return.The only reason I am still thinking of keeping these for now is the Big battery case.Will edit the post after 2-3 days for more info.Edit1:I returned it on 3rd day as it was hurting my ears while keeping them on.I learned that we don't need that Big battery case as in general cases we can't completely drain the buds and case charging in a day or two.The sound quality is not good as its bass is not equally distributed is what I felt.There are other better options in the same price range like oneplus buds z and other brand TWS.IMPORTANR NOTE: DRIVER SIZE DOES MATTER A LOT ON SOUND QUALITY.",3.0 
480,Okay for the price,"The BOAT Team did well on the product with all the good intent but there are some points which I did not like:1. The touch (capacitive?) is too sensitive. Slight touch of your hand will trigger the function.2. Both ear-buds' batteries do not last for the same time. One of them dies sooner making you switch to mono. I had gotten my first ear-buds replaced for this issue but it persists with the second set too.3. The ear phones cannot be used seamlessly with laptops. Although they can pair, but there will be audio delay/lag.4. Volume is tad low.Good things comes in small packages:1. Good bass2. Good noise isolation (passive).3. Very-very small hence portable (including the charging case).4. Fair treble.",3.0 
481,"Amazing airpods, worth the price!!","Worth every penny! Very good sound quality abd fits perfectly in the ears, doesn't hurt even after wearing them for a long time.As compared to Boult Audio AirBass Powerbuds, these ones are anyday better than boult ones, in terms of sound as well as comfort. I had a bad experience of having received a defective boult product and the replacement was also a used product, so had to return those as well.Go for these without a doubt!",5.0 
482,Not a great product (got some sound when not playing any music),"Firstly the product is fine for the price range of Rs 2500 and please don't give more than that for this product.Why I returned it?1. Very bad sound in the background when the earbuds were not playing anything. (might be a defect in the product I received)2. Build quality is not great.3. I mainly bought it for the battery backup but I was disappointed with the audio which is much more important to anyone.4. Delay while watching some videos. Controls work sometimes and other times I don't know why they get stuck.I feel, if you want good quality in audio without a very tight budget then if you shell out another Rs500 to Rs1000 you can get really better ones.",3.0 
483,FAADU BASS,"I usually don't write review unless the product is truly impressive but whenever the product quality exceeds your expectations, you are compelled to write a review. Being Gadget freak and Audiophile, any Audio product I buy the core criteria has to be BASS effect. Whether its Car Speaker, Woofer, Subwoofer, Sound bar, Headphone, Earphone and these days Airpods... The first thing I read in product review is BASS Effect. After having returned 2 Airpods earlier due to Ordinary Sound Quality, I wasn't expecting too much on BASS Front. But since I already have one Boat over the head, bluetooth headphone I was aware of Boat Audio Quality so went for Boat TWS 441. And I can say if u r BASS Crazy like I am, u at least wont be disappointed. Forget not that this is earphone and not headphone so u can't have too loud a sound. But I am truly impressed by the Booming BASS effect of this piece. It has become my go-to earphone for listening to my favorite Audio Tracks.",5.0 
484,Decent true wireless earphones for the price,"This review is after 2 months of daily use. I got these in Aug'20 for 1999/-.The buds and the box is made of plastic and is very light. There is no premium feel to it.They are a good deal when compared to other earbuds for the same price range. On an average the ear buds last for approx 3 hrs on a single charge. The box and the buds together last for almost 20 hours. Charging time is approx 2 hours. The earbuds have a audible battery indicator which says ""Oops Battery Low"" when the battery level in the buds drop to around 10%. There is also a battery indicator that is displayed in the notification bar of your phone.Considering that both the batteries in the earbuds are the same, the right earbud battery drains more quickly than the left. The left will work for another 30-45 minutes after the right one has died.The sound quality is good however the bass is a little to much. However, Boats are known for their high bass earphones. A Boat app with equalizer and other functions would have really made a difference, however there is no equalizer option, neither can you change or control the volumes through the ear buds.The audio quality and clarity during calls is good.The Bluetooth reception however is not too great. The buds tend to loose connection with your phone at a distance of approx 15/18 feet. Sometimes a single wall between me and my phone can make it loose connection.The capacitive buttons work well but are a little too sensitive. If you accidently touch the bud when you touch your head or ear, it will register as a press and will pause or change the track.Will need to see how they perform over the period of time.Overall this is a good buy for the current price range considering the playback time and sound quality.",4.0 
485,Gets the job done!,"Great design love how it's compact and simple, fits perfectly in my ear with the default buds if not there are different sizes to choose from. Seemless paring on any device (PC, Game console, Phones are the ones that I tested on, no issues whatsoever) However don't recommend it for gaming! Okayish battery life around 4-5 hours on a single charge and the case can charge up the buds upto 3 times with a full battery of itself! Touch controls are a bit fuzzy sometimes doesn't work that well especially in wet conditions or if you're covered in sweat or water! Bass is good, noise cancelation works really well and over all feels premium. Totally would recommend it!",4.0 
486,Pure Powerpacked Performer,"The airdopes just got delivered and I've spent the last hour listen to them without a break. I don't think I'm taking one anytime soon.I must say I'm really impressed with the quality of this product. Offers amazing base with clear trebles. For the ones who are sceptical about the noise cancellation I must say it isn't bad, maybe just a notch below par the standards set by its other features.The functionality is fairly simple compared to other products in the same segment.Loved it!A big shout-out to boat (Vocal for Local) 🙂",5.0 
487,Touch controls?? They sure had me fooled,"Bought it one day. Then i wanted to return it the next day. Why? u may ask.Main reason - The touch response scales from very bad to non-existent.Mini reason - doesn't fit well in my earsOkay then... I got to know that u can't return this wonderful device on 1st attempt coz replacement policy comes 1st. U see... I'm a sensible person and was like '' no problem! The replacement might be better''.I received the replacement few days later.Surprise! Surprise! They fooled me twice. The earbuds worked well... Only for the 1st 2 days. Then came the same inevitable touch response problem. I was like ""ugh... They work sometimes when I reset the buds. I'm all for Indian tech so I'll try to manage. I'll just stop using the touch controls''. (lemme tell u that I paid 2k for this)2 days later.....chapter - 2 had begun.One of the buds kept disconnecting constantly and required frequent resetting of the buds. This! My friends... is where I draw the line. I want to return it asap. But that thing is.. It is midnight rn and u can't return this item without talking to a customer service person 1st (top-notch huh?!).Hmm...

491,Not Recommended for high bass & Sound lover.,Got for 1599 Rs in Amazon Great Indian Festiv sale.Not at all satisfied with the sound quality.There is low sound and not high. Bass is also low. We can only feel bass in some music which are purely bass based. For the people who are Heavy bass and sounf liver it is NOT FOR THEM. Call quality is Ok. But overall it is not good.

494,Honest Review,"These Airdopes are good as compared to others in the same budget. Sound quality is excellent. One may face range problem if you phone is in the pocket he or she can face noise distortion some times. Moving further, batter life is very good not as mentioned but still okay. Looks are perfect but you may get bit low vibes from inside. Fitting is perfect you can use these while running, jogging and gyming. They don't get harmed in sweat but I haven't tried them in water. Touch function are not that much quick. If you are looking for good Airdopes under 3000 INR you should go for these.",4.0 
495,Very bad Durability,"I rarely write reviews. This is a great product - only for the first year. The moment it stepped on the 13th month, issues popped up (mine is in the 14th month). The left earbud currently has only 30 minutes of battery life - pathetic!!! Also, every 1 or 2 minutes either of them will lose volume and i have to put it in the case and take it back out to regain the volume. Cannot use it anymore for movie watching, music or even online classes. If not for that the product is amazing. But whats the use... a butterfly doesn't live long. So, buy the product with that in mind.",2.0 
496,Terrific purchase but 3 things to notice,After using these airdopes for around 3 months i am writing this review and i must  saw it is an another awesome product with a good price as always.I bought it in a sale and got it for 2500Sound quality is awesome and bass quality too is terrific.If you talk about noise cancellation it is also very good in terms of other products  in this price range.There are three issues(major or minor you decide on your own)-:1. Battery life for each earbud is low as they comes with a small battery and case gives them 4 charges as said by company but the battery life of each of them is just 4-4 and half hours with continous usage with volume 60%-70%.2.This might not be an issue for people who only just loves bass but these airdopes are pre configured by company to give maxx output in terms bass this means that vocals are little suppresed by bass all the time and you want vocals to be good and bass less then there is an option but it depends on device i.e by using equalizer3.I think this is a major issue that there are no touch controls for adjusting volume of airdopes and it is set to 100% everytime you start them for laptops it is always set to 100% when i connect them but in smartphones android normalizes the volume to 40%And if you are planning to use with smart tv then forget about it as there no controls on buds for volume and most of the smart TVs don't support volume adjustment of bluetooth devices from them.Thank you for giving it a reading and i would be very happy to help fellow buyers.,5.0 
497,Best eardopes for the budget,"Quality of the buds are premium.. good material used for the case, the best advantage of 441pro version is battery life once charge the buds easily you can use it for a week.

Dried using towels and after 5 mins ready to play.So build quality is very good. Fitting has been perfect for me.Now to the most important part- sound quality.

The case is small, and sturdy. Type c charging is also a huge blessing, as I don't have to carry a micro b cable just for my headphones. It charges pretty fast as well, in about an hour or so for complete charge.The controls on these headphones are a bit finicky as they are capacitive touch, but there are a lot of different options-skip tracks, call up assistant, pause-play, answer/reject calls etc... but there is one control that is missing-Volume Control.

523,Automatically disconnect one earpiece.,"If you don't play anything or pause the sound for a few moment, one of the earpiece automatically gets disconnect. This is super annoying as well as irritating. Suppose you have to talk to someone or listen to something in between the songs or videos and you pause the sound. At that moment one will get disconnected and if you start the song or video again, you will only hear it in one of the earpiece. This makes it impossible to interact with people in between you songs. Suppose You have a helmet or a scarf or something around your head or the case is not easily reachable. In that case you have to remove the helmet or something, remove both the earpiece, put them together inside the case, close the case and connect it again and insert it again in you ear. This makes it super useless for day to day life activities. I don't know why one disconnects if the song or the video is paused for a moment. If anybody has a solution please comment it below.",1.0 
524,Good deal,Hi I was using jbl earbud before this. However it was not waterproof and I screwed it up in running.Sound : comparable no issuesNoise control: this is not having good noise cancellationFit has an issue sometime I feel pain in my ears if I wear it for longConnectivity is good as u don't hv to on/ off before you startOverall a good deal and feeling satisfied so far,4.0 
525,Decent full wireless headphone with an immense drawback,,4.0 
526,Product is satisfactory but the service is absolutely terrible.,The media could not be loaded.,3.0 
527,Stopped working after a month," This is a decent headphone. Sound quality is fine, bass is satisfactory,noice cancellation is moderate but has an immense problem when it comes to speaking it has tremendous surrounding noice. Your voice can't be heard from the opposite side. It's dull when it's speaking with noice.I hope boat can take some step.",1.0 
528,Chrrp sound in the left earpod,"They were awesome at first. The ear pains a little because of it's structure. But the grip and the sound quality is very nice. The product worked fine for a month but then there were some issues with it.Contacting the boat service centre was difficult to at first. The phone number given on their website is always busy.Then I wrote them a mail and then on the communication was easy but their service is too slow. It's been a month now and I still haven't received the airdopes back! It's very irritating... They give the reason of covid but a month is really not acceptable...If you are looking for some nice Bluetooth headset, I suggest you buy JBL's headphones... I have them and have never faced an issue.Boat's service is awful and trust me you don't want to go through the trouble of replacement.",5.0 
529,Mixed feelings but worth buying as a spare,"The first pair of airdopes which I received were defective, so I ordered a replacement. Now the replacement airdopes have also stopped working and it's just been a month since I got them. Did not expect this from Boat. I can't return it or replace it now and I've paid for something that I cannot use. Disappointed!",3.0 
530,Bang for the bucks,"VALUE FOR MONEY: Paisa VasoolSound quality: Good, actually best below 5000/- range.Noise cancellation: not cool but can live with it not a deal breaker. If you still want good noise cancellation, cough up some extra bucks (7-10,000/-)Bass Quality: excellent for the price point it is available. Bassheads will not regret buying it (though select the right buds from supplied package).All in all, good value for money",5.0 
531,Never Buy This Product - They are cheating their Customer - Waiting for Refund,Very bad product. Amazon this time you disapponted me. I am not sure why you listing such poor product on Amzon.

532,Perfect device in the perfect price.,"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. This is gonna be a detailed review and I will cover mostly all the features and topics.Pros:1. The sound quality is extremely good, clear audio and detailed treble and bass.2. The bass is deep and covers all the high, mid and lows.3. The IWP-Instant Wake Pair technology works pretty well the phone almost instantly gets paired there sometimes might be a slight delay of 2-3 seconds for pairing when you open the case.4. The battery inclusive of the pod and case last for about 2 and a half days when used extensively.5. Charging is quite fast with the type-C charger.6. Noise cancellation too works pretty fine.7. The fit is superb, it doesn't fall off your ears even when you ride a bike or scooty and your body jerks due to the movement.Cons:1. The major problem I faced is the connectivity, the range isnt very strong and you will face issues like choppy and laggy audio when you and your phones are 2 small rooms apart.2. Though this isn't a major issue and i faced it only once, sometimes when you use two pods separately there is an audio imbalance. For example, I took out one pod out of the box and decided to use it for 15 mins and then decided to plug in the other one into my ear after 15 mins so the 2nd pod i take out of the box doesn't plays the audio until you keep both the pods in the case close the case and reopen it.Overall, it is a good product in such a price range and I would recommend you to buy this.",5.0 
533,worth every penny...,"Writting thus review after using the airpodes for10 days...Its just awesome...  Initially i had a ear pain as i was using it for long ours... After a day 2 got into habit..Product wise its worth every penny...  Connectivity,  sound,  base,  water resistance, touch sensors Everything is perfect...10/10👌👌👌👌",5.0 
534,Very good budget pods to have,"Sound quality is good and seamless in connecting with mobile each time. small earbud fits well. if fits well in ears, is great and also helps noise cancellation. Can do exersice wearing it wothout any issue. Just touch is too sensitive (good sense and also bad sense), as sometimes when try to adjust pods in ear to audio/video stops instantly.But overall its great and got cheap in offer and enjoying it.",4.0

To bhailog mene pure raste iss ko use Kara delhi to Ajmer and ajmer se aane ke baad bhii around 10-12 din chala bahut op battery backup hai aur bass bhi bahut accha hai aur NCS bhi thik hai i love this product 💚,5.0 
538,VERY VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS. CANT HEAR VOICE AND SPEAK 😭😭😟😟😡😡,"Works well, Noise cancellation works nice. Battery also works well, after full charging it stays about 4-5 hours and the container box able to charge it around 5-8 times without getting charged.Sound quality also good.",3.0

541,"Don't think too much, just buy !","The regular price is 1999 but I purchased it in 1799 when the sale was going on.Amazon delivered it on time and the packaging was ok, I mean there was not any second box making it safer though there was only polythene and then the original box itself but not the big issue here I guess.1: Talking about the product, The build quality is pretty good. It gives premium look. The case along with eardopes is not too heavy but the eardopes having satisfiable weight to feel something good quality.2: Connectivity is very fast, you just have to pair manually the first time, and then it would connect automatically within seconds after opening the case.3: Touch Sensitive button work very well but it does take a second response. Also, these buttons sometimes annoy. Like if you are just readjusting your eardopes then accidentally the touch may respond ending up pausing the music or hung up the call.4: Battery is pretty good, I use 2 to 3 hours continuously without using them and the case can be alive for up to 2 days if you are not a heavy user.Not good is that your ear will start hurting for sure if you are using them for more than 45 minutes.Pro tip: If you want to use both eardopes to different devices then connect both with one device, keep one eardope with that device and walk far away from that device taking another eardope until it disconnects. Then when it disconnects, connect it with a different device there only. Come back to your place and voila enjoy both eardopes as different Bluetooth devices.",4.0

543,Great quality. Buyable.,"It is a great product in this price range. Great noise cancellation and sound quality is also great. If you want bass dominated these won't do. Probably would give 3.5 stars.The left earbud though keeps falling off, I don't know whether its the ear or the earbud itself😅.Another major defect is the battery life, it doesn't last 5 hours on a single charge. Max lasting is 4-4.30 hrs. Somtimes when u use meeting apps it goes down to 3.30-45 hrs.",4.0

547,Perfect but too sensitive,"Everything is perfect about these earphones. Bass is superb. Best in this range. A treat for music lovers. But it is a pain in the neck for calling purposes. It is tooooo sensitive. If u even touch it slightly while touching your hair or re-adjusting them a bit in your ears, it would cut the call. It does the same if you are lying in ur bed and it touches your pillow. It is also loose in my ears so I dread to wear it out. But if u are looking for music purposes, then go ahead, I feel it's the best in the range.",5.0

As battery gets low, the sync between the pods get off, so you start getting variable sounds in your ears. Felt this a couple of times. Gives you a headache.4. You simply can't drop the pods in the charger, you have to adjust it sometime to bring it charging state, which i feel is bad.",2.0 
550,Perfect under this Price Budget.,I am using this for about 15 days now. I am an huge fan of boat. I am almost using 5 products of boat. For this Product Sound Quality is good. You actually have to reduce the volume after listening for some time on high volume. Touch sensitivity is good but requires 1 second to take actions. You can use it while riding in Helmet but sometimes the listener won't be able to hear your sound while on call. Battery life is actually better than i expected. I saw the reviews that a person need to charge it after using it for a couple of hours.. Actually it is not happening in my case. Idk 😅 I have been using them for hours and then I get bored with them and you can easily put them back and let them charge. Even I haven't heard any battery low sound yet.One can purchase it..I suggest you to hear BELIEVER 8D in this.. You will be in love with these. 💕,5.0 
551,Not working properly within 4 months of purchase,I purchased this product on 12th Aug 2021 and within 4 months that is today 15th of Dec 2021 I I not able to hear any audio from 1 ear dope nor it is charging properly . 1 ear dope seems to be fully null because it's not providing any output nor we are able to hear anything. The company seems to assure guarantee of 1 year but it started malfunctioning withing 4months. Is this kinda commitment you provide to your customers? Being using boat products since quiet a long time this is the worst service experience I have ever had.,1.0

553,Best hands free headset in this segment,"I have been using a boat roakerz 335 wireless band before, mainly for Gym workouts. However, at times during workouts, you don't really feel comfortable with the band as the ear bud keeps popping out. And there is no function controls other than changing volume, every time i have to tap next from my phone to play next song.Then ordered this one, sound quality is amazing. It comes with pre-built function, where you can change next track with a single tap, touch controls are so soft. As soon as I received the product, played 8 D, 16 D songs of A R rahman from you tube, you will definitely feel the premium sound quality.The case is so handy, easy to carry and it comes with charging cable as well. Doesn't take much time for full charge. At this price, you wouldn't find any other brand with such quality sound. Go for it, its worth it.",5.0

555,Buy this and regret !!,"You should definitely buy this set of earphones if you like to waste your money. Amazon doesn't take its returns and the only option we have is to exchange these. The problem is with the model, it is bad, no matter how many times you exchange it. I have never seen earphones that don't even get properly charged. Apparently only one earpiece gets charged and the other one clearly doesn't fit the case well. Lights don't work on one of the earpieces. I replaced it for these two reasons but the new one shows the same problems. The microphone is terrible. I am blown by the fact that this product has a 4-star rating. It's not even worth half its advertised price in my opinion. Boat's quality is usually good but this model is bad by all means.",1.0 
556,There couldn't be a better motto for these than 'Plug into Nirvana',"I was apprehensive of these before i bought them. But as soon as I put them in my ears, all my doubts vanished into thin air.*How's the fit? - Couldn't be more secure; be it headbanging to heavy metal or a long run. The buds won't budge, not at all.* The battery life seems to be too good to be true, is it? - You get exactly what you see. The battery life is a banger. You can listen to these on long hikes and runs, without the fear of not being able to charge them.* Is the sound quality good enough? - boAt does say 'NIRVANA', right!?* Will it be able to handle sweaty workouts? - IPX7 rating!! Just took a long shower in these and couldn't be any happier. If it can handle a full on shower, then don't you worry about your sweat.For the discounted price of 2500, it feels like i have cheated boAt out of the money that they so rightfully deserved.",5.0

561,Great Earbuds surely recommended for music and bass lovers,I bought these on Diwali and got them for an amazing price of 15K which was a great deal and was budget friendly .The sound of these earbuds is great and balanced and bass quality is also awesome. I haven't used Boat products before but I loved these and recommend everyone to go for it blindly.After using for so months I am facing a little bit unnecessary sound from the left earbud but it doesn't spoiled the quality of music and they are also working fine.Battery backup is also great in these earbuds I got at least 2 days of charge after charging the case but it also depends how you use it.At last I would say that a great earbuds at this cost is just fine.,4.0

563,Quite BADASS,This boat 441 ear buds are quite badass. The sound quality is excellent with superb bass. Battery backup is excellent goes up for 4 hrs with single charge. I got this for 1599 if you get this for higher prices please wait for some sale you will definitely get it on low price.,5.0 
564,One time budget investment,It is really good and when i am travelling through highway even while sitting on a Royal Enfield and passing from fast winds you still can clearly listen to the music just the bass is slightly too much but you can adjust them using an app or from your music setting configuration but over all its noise cancellation quality and battery performance is upto the mark and i am enjoying it.,5.0 
565,Best airpods ever,"The boAt 441 is just amazing. Unmatched sound quality. Bass is next level. And at the price that amazon is offering it at (2499.00) it's a steal deal. I feel brands like Bose, Jabra and so many other top brands that price their airpods at over 10k are just hyped and unjustified. The boAt 441 can easily give them a run for their money.",5.0 
566,Great product.,The battery backup is really amazing. I brought the airdopes in december and till date i haven't charged the whole case even once. The sound quality is good. A special note: if using for calls try to talk in a quiet place as the eardopes do not have ANC so even the slightest sound is heard. Else the product is good. Because extra earbuds and ear support is given it becomes easy to fit any size of ear. Using for a long period like 5 hrs can cause pain in the ears. But overall great product. Would rate it 4.3 out of 5.,5.0 
567,Battery Backup Issue,Everything was perfect including the sound quality and bass. But the important feature that is lagging is the battery backup. I used it at 100℅ volume the left ear lasts for around 150 minutes and the right ear for around 115 minutes. But the company claims for upto 5 hrs. So considering the efficiency to be around 72-75 ℅ it should at least last for around 3.5 hrs. But it failed.,4.0 
568,OVER PRICED AND HIGH LATENCY!!,"There are many aspects to rate truly wireless earphones, out of which 441pro performed decent to well in most aspects. They're comfortable, gives pretty good sound quality and decent bass performance.The only 2cons that made me return the earphones are1. High latency/lag during gaming. I could observe a very minor latency while watching Netflix on mobile.2. Touch sensitive buttons are not so responsive and some times the song gets paused for like no Reason.",3.0

572,Overall review,Amazing product for the price.My advice go for any true wireless but it should have a secure fit feature so that it does not fall off.At the same time also check if you are comfortable with something pressing in your ears as these sometimes ache if you wear it for a long duration of time.Sound quality is amazing there is no issue in listening to music.Calling is also perfect you have clear conversation on phone.Noise cancellation is also perfectOnly thing is you cannot control volume.Size is amazingly small but sufficient and easy to carry in pocket.The charger is slightly tight. You have to press it hard all the way inside other wise it will not charge.One small issue for iPhone users is you will not have a fast charger of 2A so it may take longer time to charge if you do not have any other charger. So please take this into account.I have tried wearing it for a very long time and my advice take a break for after 1/1.5 hours to let your ears rest.,5.0 
573,Quite a disappointment.,"It has been 6-7 months since I have had these. So many issues , the touch doesn’t work effectively. They are supposed to disconnect from the device if they are charging but it just stays connected , and the battery keep draining. The sound quality is bearable at the most. And this is the one I received after I sent back the first one in which you could hear a buzz through out . Not a good buy. My previous Bluetooth earphones worked for almost 2 years, this purchase is quite a disappointment.",2.0 
574,'boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds',I received a faulty piece as the right ear buds charge holding capacity was very low initially and now it doesn't power On at all. Left ear buds touch function doesn't work properly. I have sent numerous emails not getting proper response in terms of service or replacement I have been following no updates so far. Boat customer service number doesn't work either always busy. After sales support and service is really pathetic and appalling. I would strongly not recommend based on my experience pathetic and appalling customer experience.,1.0 
575,Just get it,"Long story short - I'm lovin it.Got myself a BoAt airdopes 441 Pro on 26th Oct sale costing me 2250 INR and got it delivered the next day. I like classic black colour so don't judge those pics.Now let's go see in detail what i got at this price -A charging case with 2500mAH capacity -  came in 75% charged in box.  case has the left(L) and right(R) pods mentioned, glad to see this small detail from BoAt.A flat wire USB-C cable roughly 1 ft in length (top right in pic).3 pairs of SML ear plugs. 1 extra M sized plug is affixed to earpods itself.1 extra pair of rubber sleeve (top left in pic). Really mindful of BoAt to include an extra pair.Now let's talk about the real issues.Build and visuals -Earpods are made of plastic but sturdy and feel well made.Pods look quite small in size at first but are heavier once placed in your ears. Heaviness takes its toll gradually on your ears and you may feel it all the time.The EarPods are bit slippery when clutched in fingers and may fall if not handled properly.Touch surface is decorated with RGB lighting and looks awesome.Material of provided sleeves and eartips is also of good quality and soft to touch.Charging case is a bit bulkier compared to basic model given larger battery size. The flap (top lid) I felt to be a bit flimsy compared to entire case, could have been a bit heavier.Usage -The EarPods are rated at 35mAH each with a usage time of 5 hours playback. I have been using it non-stop at 50-60% sound output and for me it has lasted for more than 5 hours in continuous usage.Touch controls are good addition as it eases a lot of operational headaches however response could be a bit better. I found that after pausing the music I could put my hands down easily before playback was actually paused.You can use each EarPod separately and it is able to function on its own for both music and calls.Call quality is actually quite decent which was a bit surprising for me for such price range.Controls are simple -  Single touch for play/pause and receiving calls (any ear).  Double touch left earpod for previous, right for next and any of them for ending call.  Long press for deactivate/shutdown the EarPods.EarPods feedbacks with ringtones when turning on/off or (un)pairing.They automatically get disabled after a few minutes if disconnected.Could not muster up courage to test IPX7 water proofing but if any brave soul can muster up the courage, put your results here. :PSound/Music QualityGreat, for this price range). I have been using MI In-ear pro wired headset for last 3 years and it’s comparable to that with better bass.It’s a bit Bass heavy but hey most of us like that, don’t we ;)Sound  I found a bit muffled and soft when on call but everything was clear for communication.RangeHaven’t tested range of 10 meters in open area but indoors could at most walk 3 meters with wall(s) in between. I found sound to be breaking when beyond 2 walls (6 in thick).Still need to check call quality in open and loud areas. Will do that once out of house at a busy hour.As a general user, so far I have found the airdrops 441 pro to be of my liking. I hope you will also feel the same.The star rating on Amazon does not do justice to this product and should be between 4 and 4.2 stars.Go for it. Its a very good choice for casual users at this price range.",4.0

If I stand somewhere and listen to songs, there is no issueBut if I walk, it will be disconnected. I don’t know why such an issue with Airdopes",3.0 
577,"Product was bad, but Amazon remain true to their word","I was using boat products for last three years now. But this one was very disappointing. It did not connect well with either my laptop or my mobile. The sound quality was good but connectivity issue ruined my experience. I recommend we should avoid this product.But the best part was how Amazon handled the return process. Though lockdown was there and situation was bad out there, the entire process vor return and refund was very smooth and very professionally handled. I am associated with Amazon for long time now, and it's really good to have such an organisation around.",1.0 
578,Nah..so poor connectivity,"What a bad product man.This promises like alot lot,but when when you actually get it and start using you feel how bad quality one can deliver.Range is bad,bass is worse,sound quality is bad.and still you can recover from these, because to be honest you actually paid eay less then other options,still connevtivity? It just disconnects like ramdom,while you're playing some music on your connected device and you haven't moved an inch since last 2 3 hours.Why produce and market such device then. My advice..if you can manage such disconnecticity then go for it.but if not,spend better like the way i should had.",1.0 
579,One of Best Purchase I've ever made.,"I've been using these harshly for years. Still worked fine for 8 months, but then eventually one side was discharging faster than the other and the mic wasn't up to expectation since the beginning I think but sound is great.After 8 month I filed a complaint at boat website and got totally fresh product again. Seems better than last one. Hoping this works for 8 months too. Going to Be a boat head. It's awesome.Update : Earbud replacement not working right.",3.0 
580,Amazon fulfilled products might also be the faulty/defective,I got replaced one against the previous but with the same nois problem in left bud. In left bud It sounds ( like durdarshan tune) bip for some time when ever it connects to the device that is my mobile and it also sounds like that on the starting of any vedio or audio. So after using two different 441 i can surely say that all of the boat ear dops might be defective. And main thing is that this product is fulfilled by amazon. So you can think what the Amazon fulfilled products might be. This product really does not justify the price. You might get it at more lower price but as per me it is not worth at all.,1.0

For short hours less than hour it's fine.",4.0 
586,"Good product, Good Sound & calling quality with decent play time.","I have used them for a week or so and I must say it's a good product overall at this price range.

Very Comfortable, won't fell pain in ears even if using for long hours.The overall sound quality is also very good ( not the best but good), the bass quality is great but sometimes overpowers lows and mids. Call clarity is also good. The other person might get a bit noise when in heavy traffic or very windy area.Connectivity is also good. But after 10m distance you might get disruption in connection.The battery back up is also decent enough.

593,"Absolute product in category of ""Value for Money""","Believe me, you will not find a better one in this price. This is an independent buyer view. Despite of anti-china made wave in country I had to go for it due to budget constraint. In this low price range, the sound quality , range of bluetooth connectivity, technical specifications can only be fullfilled by boAT. One of the USP is the Capacitive Touch Control. Its sensitive & it distinguish between one tap vs two taps vs 3 taps very  intelligently.  Noise cancellation is very effective. Bike riders are recommended to use one bud while riding as you will not hear anything. I felt that voice is little less clear on phone calls (specially when you are moving or walking or running) as people on call ask to repeat what I speak but then its 4 out 5 times work really perfect. Go for it if you are planning a ear bud experience in low price. Charging time is 3.5-4 hours for full charge and continuously it runs for approx 5 hours including music and calls. It fits very well in ears if you are an adult. It comes with a C type cable and additional buds as per different ear size so can be used by kids. 100% phone volume will make you feel like you are experiencing a home theatre or a DJ club.",5.0 
594,Awesome thanks,"This airport of Vote is very good, ears are very comfortable, their sound quality is very good, the base is boosted and the battery is very good, along with the charging type C which is also a very good thing. After 6 months, the airport on the left has deteriorated, its battery is low, but I have put it in warranty, so it is just a little bit that it is not lacking in the rest of the product",5.0 
595,Biggest regret so far in my listening experience,"I learnt  a lesson and i am sharing my experience here, so that someone can benefit from it. Atlast no-one can make all mistakes himself to learn a lesson.Before reading my review, please note that i am an audiophile, loves trying different kinds of headphones, earphones with varying tech like wireless, wired or combination of both. I always go for good brands, but this time some person suggested me and i was having low budget and needed some day-to-day headphones.Now note :1. You would never need the advertised big 2600 mAh battery for so called EMERGERNCY purposes to charge your phone, and when i say never, i mean it. I thought of same, never used it for that purpose ever. So if that big advertisement of big battery and 150hours of charging was one point for buying it, cross it out.2. Sturdy, yes they are composed from good quality of PLASTIC, and i mean they are lightweight so even if you drop them from 33,000 feet, they won't break. But i guess you are not planning to put it under hydraulic press anyways.3. Not good bass or doesn't make different pitches or notes sound that much clear. Average on that point.4. BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS THE DESIGN OF PRODUCT AND SOFTWARE USED. See when you buy a wireless earphone you expect it to use without much involvement of your hands right. Now with this product, the accidental touches makes the listening experience far worse, they pause the song in between even if the surface gets touched by a blanket of your pocket cloth. Not that touch sensitive. Very poor software design. It makes the listening experience a wrecker.5. Now coming to the last point that they stay in ear with their ERGONOMIC DESIGN, poor claim....believe me they won't stay in your ear if your are planning for gym or running.I would say invest some more money and go for good brand like skullcandy, sony, jabra. Please don't fall for the advertisements.PS: boat become popular cause of low per capita income and it offers very poor quality. While in brands like sony, skullcandy, jabra...they invested years and years to have that kind of experience. It the years that you would pay for to buy their product and you will definitely notice the difference.",3.0 
596,No Clear Voice for Voice Calls,"I Have bot this Product last week, packaging was good and design was but, i lately recognized it as my voice is very poorly audible to the receiver of my calls, by the time i recognize it my option to return this product got disabled.I mainly took this product for hand free calling, but my voice is very low, breaks and poorly audible to the other person.I request for return of this product.",2.0 
597,Great product,"Great product, compared to others, the mic’s sound catching quality is great. Don’t have to shout and talk like the other products in the market. My dog bit the box and one airdope was in her mouth. Washed it with water. Still it works like new. I love it. A recommended buy.",5.0 
598,Good product in the given price range,a very good product in price range. I got it in 1999 and 10% card discount. so a very good deal.regarding sound its average. noise cancellation should have been better. its not bad either.for music and videos its good and battery backup too is fantastic.i loved these so much that I ordered two more for my parents as these are so easy to configure and use.no pain after constant usage of 2 hours. during workout also fitting is proper.,5.0 
599,Worth buying,"Starting with sound quality, it's pretty good, bass is not evenly balanced but can be managed with volume. Talking of battery backup, it performed way better than my expectations. It can function for more than 20 hours if used efficiently. Touch is too sensitive also it can't control volume. For that one has to use mobile or smartwatch. Volume control is an essential function which is missing in airdopes 441. Connectivity is great, it can work within the range of 6 to 8 m. Bluetooth actually means good coverage and it's fulfilled in here. I also faced a latency of 500ms while gaming and using social media. It looks cool something boAt is known for. In short, it's worth buying.",4.0

601,Not as expected.,Returning the product due to many consPro- Sound is good but not too loud. Bass was OK.Cons- 1- Next person on call was able to hear low sound during call2- My left earbud gave very small buzz noise when no music was played which felt irritating3- I charged the case completely to 100% and used it for 2 days for a total of 10-15 hours but the case showed less than 25% battery which is not appropriate to the claim of 150 hours4- Fit is not that good maybe for my ear size.Note: Use the case as a powerbank only when it too necessary as it is mentioned in the manual.Use 10 W charger to charge the case.,3.0 
602,Se the full review,"I have used this product since 1 month and i could say that a i am quite satisfied with the airpods for calling its an average product but for music, movies its awesome.. The bass is quite good.. Not for those who have small ears.. Mark my word. it gives you a 2.5 to 3 hours of backup while calling and 3.5 to 4 hours if listening to music or watching movies.. The case is 500 mah so u can chare it 3to 5 times more that's great.Cons: 1. No volume control 2. No number is said while incoming calls",4.0

The right side Airbud looses it's charge quickly... I kept it inside the case for 1 whole day and even the case was fully charged and still it dint give me even 1 hour play back time.And must say their customer services just make you go craziee...

604,Different smartphones different sound quality.,The sound quality varies upon different smartphones.Don't blame the product if having bad quality or low quality sound.I have OnePlus 7t and the sound is really amazing.. not life wired earphones bt the difference is really not major.,5.0 
605,Owsome bass,My review is after using the product for more than a week.Pros## The build quality of dopes and our case is superb it feels premium and sturdy. Now comiy to Airdopes the sound quality is really owsome with amazing bass and vocals are also clear you can not feel any distortion or sound lagging.They also stay fit inside ears. The music play time Ka 2hours and 40 minutes to 3 hours and same applies to call Quality with case the range goes up to 20 hours .Cons## play time and call time could have been better like 3:30 to 4 hours .Another drawback I found is its sensitive capacitive touch button even by change of you slightly touch the button the call gets disconnected or the music stops .I think a dedicated button is butter than touch button. Over all value for money .Go for it if you can manage 3 hours playback and call time .,4.0

It works for approx 5 hrs as claimed by boat.And the charging case having feature of power bank function is great. You can charge your other devices in case of emergency.Audio video sync is nice while playing a video.I have even tried playing pubg, and there was not much of latency.So we can play pubg with this airdopes.I purchased it for 2499 and it's definitely a great purchase at this price considering all the features.",5.0

When I recived the Boat 441 in first time feels Good in Bass and sound clarity.But battery backup of carry case is only sufficient for 2 times full charge of ear buds.In the same time buds battery backup is good enough for 3.5 hrs. So I plan to change the carry case.But boat service center says not possible to change carry case only.We are sending charging case along with buds.I said ok.2.Wthin 1.5 weeks I received  another set. But this time Ear buds sound quality and bass was very poor compared to previous one.Also backup of buds only for 2 hours maximum. But carry case is sufficient for 4 full charging near to company said. So I again disappointed and plan to return for another pair.So again I went to boat service  center. This time they have stock in ready for giving me on the spot .I replaced old one.3.Now this time situation is good sound quality and bass as I received first time. But battery backup of buds is only 2 hours like second time. And carry case backup is sufficient for nearly 3.5 times charging of buds.I am totally disappointed😭.what I do next.Please consider seriously this situation. This is intimation to company marketing authorities to. Solve this issue.Because company says 5 hours backup for buds for moderate sound.And 4 full charging for buds (Excluding first charging ).,2.0 
637,Okayish. Too bassy,"Bass is very boomy. I shouldnt complain becuase I wantd it to be a bit bassy. Problem is - there is no way to tone it down as and when needed. On dialogue heavy things like podcasts or movie scenes the heavy bass is kind of drowning voice. You can hear the sound but wont understand a thing.Wired earphones work with device equalizer on both pc and mobile. But BT earphones usually wont do that.Got it for 1999 and overall its ok product. After a long session has to go to low volume to recover from the bass fatigue thats all.Fits ok, not falling off, has enough volume too.",3.0 
638,One word-PREMIUM,"The overall product feels so premium and definitely will satisfy the cost incurred, the left earphone has a light buzz wen not in use for me but other than that the product will definitely be your moneys worth... The bass is stupendous, being a total basshead I love it, the packing is done beautifully promoting the premium effect and the airdopes are very lightweight so one can use it for hours without getting nauseous and without the need for charging the case so frequently... I'm so surprised that so many features can come in such a low price for such a quality product... HATS OFF BOAT!! This is my first boat product and I think they just gained my brand loyalty...",5.0 
639,Left earbud stopped working,Writing review after 7 months. All off a sudden the left earbud stopped working and did reset many times but of no use so if u buy it rem it’s Chinese and will behave like Chinese... never know when it stops and no help from boat customer service and u will have agin spend money to buy a new ones very quickly. So thnk b4 u invest,1.0 
640,Useful Pods,"Really liked it. For general music listening it's very good, bass is nice. For using it while doing some swift movements gyming Or running ensure the pod is fixed well in the ear the extra fin like things really helped the pod stay for some time in my ear. Pairing is smooth to the phone. So i did notice a difference when calling over whatsApp vs regular call provider. I found internet calls were crystal clear. The range is surely 10 mtrs from the phone. Using only a single pod works really well. Battery back up is yet to accertained.",4.0 
641,👍Excellent earbuds,"This video my first tws, and am very much satisfied with the sound clarity. Find it better than my wired xiaomi earphones. The charging case makes use more convenient, and makes it possible to use multiple times without the hassle of repeated charging. Reasonably priced at 2499/- in a sale. No connectivity issues, most of the times.",4.0 
642,Most pathetic product and customer support,"Sent a defective product right earpiece stopped working after 15 days only, after initiating a return with BOAT customer care they sent an ugly looking yellow earpiece on top of that it also stopped working in just 4 days. They will just frustrate you ask you to drop an  email which takes 4 days to respond and another 20-25 days for your product to be replaced. Never go for such cheap product and fraud companies.",1.0 
643,Middling product. Considering the price it's okay.,"It's an average product.Fit and ergonomics- not a solid fit. Kinda 3/5. But the main problem is with the soft touch button. Since the fit is not good, every time you adjust your earphone. When you do that, the soft touch just pauses music. You keep tapping it to revive the music. A big let down. So 2/5 on that count.Sound quality: again very middling. But considering the price point, kinda ok. Probably 3.5 out of 5  for sound quality.Usage with phone call: don't use it. The person other end can't hear you, unless you shout. That's only indoors. For outdoors, forget it",3.0 
644,FIRST TIME RIGHT,The first supply did not work and was replaced. In India we have no aim for FTR - First Time Right attitude. We feel we have satisfied the customer by replacement but we are forgetting that the brand erosion has already has happened. There is no cancellation for this item cleverly planned. Amazon must have uniform policy when the reliability and quality of Indian & Chinese products are pathetic.,2.0

647,Not Great but Nice Product,"It is good product, you can buy it.- i really liked the sound quality in music, movies and videos- battery backup is good, it can used 4 to 5 hours continue and charge in only half an hour- in design and comfort I'll give 3/5, it is okay but not much comfortable in my case- and the battery charger or case's battery backup is also good, i only need to charge it once in a week, it can last long if your usage is low- the cons i found out that the right side earbud's battery drains first and the left after 5 to 10 mins, I don't know if it is a good or bad, i tried to charge both equally but this happens everyday- 2nd con is the noise cancellation not good at all, on the call the opposite person tells me everytime that he cannot hear my voice properly and the background noise is too loud, you need to find peaceful place for calls then it's good.so it is not suitable for calls but music, movies and videos it is nice.",4.0

650,Not recommended,Used it for 1 year and experience is not good. Cons:There is a issue in the earbuds. The earbuds dont pair with each other sometimes so have to restart the earbud or put it back into the case and remove it. Its quite irritating.Mic is not good.After using fr 1 year sound breaks in the middle and so cant listen to songs n allPros:Sound quality is too good as in all Boat earphonesGood Basscomfortable and it fits in ear properly.Charging time is good.,2.0 
651,Overall Good Product,"The sound quality is better than I expected as I used a headphone before it's bass quality was really nice so I was confused between tws or headphones but I did took the risk and it's really beyond my expectations if u are looking forward to purchase this product I would suggest u not to hesitate as this is worth the price overall the case is not much premium looking the bass quality is fantastic it's look are not bad not so good I prefer sound quality more than look if u can get 3 hours of listening time on the buds and u can easily depend on the case to charge 4-5 times 100% overall it's a good product and worth the price I'll suggest u to go with thisUpdate after 5 months : other side stopped working suddenly,,the case and buds plastic quality is cheap",2.0 
652,Good but not best,"Overall ok product. Sound quality is good, bass works. Battery back is very less upto 3 to 4 hrs, if use for calling purpose.

657,Buyed a mini bomb 🔥🔥,I'm writing the review after 6 months of use.The sound quality is great.However the battery doesn't last for the duration per charge as per product description.The battery backup is only for 3.5H (5 H as per product description) with each charge and an additional 10.5H (25 H as per product description) playtime with the included charging case.It's worth is similar to model Airdope 121 which is ₹ 700/- cheaper.,4.0 
658,"Useless, waste of money, BOAT brand is just scam.","Ever since I was looking for a decent pair of tws earbuds, I had my eyes on these. Got them a few days back, and they are pretty good for the price you pay.PROS- Excellent fit, once you get it right, THEY DON""T FALL. I ran for 10 km straight, sound isolation and fit remained intact- Excellent Noise Isolation- Great Battery Backup, both from the case as well as the earbuds- Small Dimensions, can fit into almost all cycling jerseys/ running gearCONS- Bass is all over the place, not punchy either- The excellent fit also creates some major pain in the ears where the fins slide in- Audio is not the best, Bass heavy. But that's not a major issue when you're using them for sportsWait for offers, I've seen them go for as low as 1800, I got them at 2000, at which they are a steal deal.",1.0 
659,Bassheads Rejoice!!,Its a little bomb i like the product very much its very comfortable to use the capasitive touch works very nicely and the led used in the buds give the proper Idea of using charging case also very good i feel a little irritating sound on right side bud sometimes that is the only problem i found overall it a good deal at this type price range go for itUpdate:- replaced due to a annoying sound on right side bud but it is common problem received product also same,4.0 
660,Overall good quality at a good price but loose fitting,"Good quality at a reasonable price.Positives:1. Reasonable price2. Good talk time3. Looks goodCons1. Loose fitting, keeps calling off2.

Just need to check the battery backup.",5.0 
662,Airdopes 411 pretty dope IMO,The airdopes 411 arrived well on time even in the pandemic situation. The bass is very good. I have used them for 5 days now and they are working very well consistently.Calls are a little tedious because i touch the sensitive touch thingy by mistake and it does it's job of cutting the call XD. Works well for zoom calls as well you just have to select the correct microphone outlet in zoom.It is very convenient to use as someone who has only one type c port for charging as well as earphones I am glad to get rid of the cycle of getting a connector and my earphones stop working and when i get new earphones mysteriously the connector stops working :'(. But now i can listen to music and charge at the same time. It is good for excercise as well as i attended an online zumba class with these on and they were perfect. Personally it hurts my ears after long use sometimes but that can be a personal issue and insie it has different sizes of buds and the other ring thingy so you can adjust as per your comfort. This price for such a good trendy product with good sound quality is a dream! Get them if you've been looking for reliable earpods.,5.0

664,I Chose boat earbuds over urban 2020 and wings,"After buying urban 2020 and wings earbuds I bought these. First order was a defective item, stopped working within one hour of usage. This one is good. There is short ticking noise u can hear from left earbud but as u play song/movie ,it stops.Sound is loud enough.. Good bass. U can't control volume. But all other controls are highly sensitive. The fit is amazing. It doesn't come out while working out. Or even skipping. My ears are small. I got urban 2020 pink coloured, amazing earbuds. But my ears started hurting with short time use only.. N fit was not as good as this one. And also they are not as costly as other branded earbuds. Very nice product, beautiful.. Looks cool.",4.0 
665,Good Sound with faulty battery,"Purchased back in November 2020. Worked good for the initial 2 months then battery backup went down to 45 mins.Definitely not worth the price as it should at the very least function without any issues for 2 years.Better to make a one time purchase of high end earpods from the likes of Sony, Apple, Samsung, etc.",2.0 
666,"Good sound, not meant for calls","Guys, this is a good product with a good quality of sound. Bass is good not bad, voice quality is not up to the mark or I can say you shouldn't expect a good voice call quality with ear buds coz the air flow will surely be a disturbance when talking.I won't compare the pros and cons but if you are not concerned about the battery life like the non-pro does not have 150 hrs so you can buy those and save a little.If you are a person who likes trekking or long drives literally long ones ;-) then go for the pro version.Once again don't expect a good quality with the voice calls when there is air flow over the mic.If you want for the sole purpose of driving and talking this is not for you, go for the ones that have a shoulder band, those mic quality are much better compared to this one.",4.0 
667,Awsmm product,"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bassJust at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm.Iys has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while . Overall great product ,only the volume at the low which does'nt sound great needs a bit fix but thumbs up great product must buy.And great delivery and packaging by Amazon",5.0 
668,Good in less expensive earbud,"Whatever so people give negative review about this product base on sound quality,it's all bogus...At the range of 2k-3k ,this product is good...Dint fall while jogging (unless u have distorted ear structure)And for backup,all batteries in universes drain out and need to charge on time...",5.0 
669,"If you trust boat products, purchase this blindly","I have been a customer of Boat headsets for over 5 years now, I was a bit hesitant to buy a TWS, even though I trust Boat products, I wasn't sure to buy it. But when I did, it passed all my expectations.Pros:-1. You are a bass lover? Buy it. Bass is so damn good for this headset.2. Battery is very good, I thought the battery would drain like anything, but No, battery is too good.3. Sound quality is too good4. Calling is decentCons:-1. The stripes may pain your ears, it depends on your ear size, if your ears are big enough, then the earbuds are very comfortable, for me my ears are a bit small, So until I place the buds in certain way, I am experiencing a slight pain after using the earbuds for like 1 hour.2. The touch, the touch is a bit complicated in this earbuds, I dont know whether this is the case for all tws, but for this, when your skin touches the charging pins on the ear buds, only then the touch works, So for the touch to work on the ear buds, you've got to place ear buds in a certain way, that touches the charging pins to ear's skin.For me touch is not at all a problem, So, I dont have any issues with that, but if thats important to you, you might wanna think about purchasing this product. But, sound is what matters to you and you have a certain budget, just go for it.This is your BUY.!!!",4.0 
670,I Like it,Awesome !!!!! eardopes !!!!. Everything is so good and also have powerbank feature which is amazing and good for those who need to purchase powerbank .

671,Don't purchase!!,"Writing this review after 4 months of using the product. The earbuds are a waste of money, do not buy them! The sound quality and battery life is good. But that is all. Has a lot of connectivity issues. Connectivity while playing media is good but during calls it disconnects every 30 secs. It is impossible to speak on calls usng these earbuds! The only good thing that has come out of buying these earphones is I can use them for music while working out and they don't fall off. My friend bought the older version of airdopes for 1500 bucks and that is much better quality and does not have such connectivity issues. Go for that instead.",2.0 
672,Boat & Regret (A Synonym),"Previously I thought I will get used to them... But the thing is these ear-buds are not at all good.As a music lover I have used products from many different companies... I also own BOAT headphones which are good. That's the reason I preferred Boat over Chinese TWS ear-buds. But I was wrong.Call Quality - 1/5Connection - 1.5/5 you have to connect manually or more than once because of sound glitch 8 out of 10 times.Sound quality - 3/5 Overloaded with bass. Misses too much of highs and mids.Verdict- I have used a lot of headphones and earphones... And believe me. I am regretting buying these. If you want to waste your money you can go for it otherwise buy OnePlus or spend more on better products.Edit: after 6 months of buying, left side tws stopped working. They provided me a refurbished unit as replacement, and after 6 more months the left side stopped working again. Now these are out of warranty, and I have to buy new tws. Paid 2,500 for 11 months... Thank you for your tws product quality Boat!",1.0 
673,reviewing after using it for 2 month,"if you just care about listening to music its perfect for you it has a good overall bass quality in the price range, it doesn't tell you on what RF its working but it has a range of 18.6m without obstruct i can feel the latency if you move the reciever or the source (your head or your phone) repeatedly but its too little that it can be ignored for general use afterall it works on RF so latency is just physics can't do much about it in any wireless system transreciever bandwith is good you can really appreciate the diversity of each soundwave in a song obviously if the song has got it, i also used it for my morning run no effect of normal sweating so far i will surely not do a water resistant test on will but so far good.. case battery is 500 mAh and 35mAh per earbud if you use 1 at a time you can get along a day or more on a full charge(case+buds) with normal usage, non-stop playback time is 4.2hrs for each earbud which i would say again is good but not great you can use 1 bud at a time to maximine the total play time, case recharge both of your buds nearly 4 times on a full charge, its good for non network gaming with negligible a latency but network/internet/online gaming is NOT RECOMMENDED not just on this but on any wireless set.. it will give you out of the world latency. thats my 2 month use review on this product, hope it helped.",4.0

The touch functions which are provided like receiving and rejecting calls, changing and pausing songs those are also very useful. I will not recommend it for gaming purpose, because there is a slight latency while playing games. Only a small drawback I found that is the touch surface is very sensitive, for that even when you try to adjust the earpods in your ears, that time also it takes the touch and performs the functionality. Apart from that the product is very good.",5.0

My right ear bud not works some time so no chance  to return the product after 10 days.High battery backup is a plus point for case and earpods .I recommend to buy semi wired blutooth  headphones  because it can be  used in bike driving.

I am not a person who do much of calling.The only thing I found best is the battery  backup ever you can buy powerbank for the rush of hour but powerbank inside is better which dont let you carry another bank. It can charge your phone to more than 50 %. And it will work for more than 10 days in light usage.Haven't  practically  tested will edit soonComfort is very good in this price range. You will get feeling of galaxy buds not one with the kidney shape. But for long term like more than 2-3 hour it might pain a little based on your ear size.Latency is freaking high. You can not play online games or any games with it. More than 300ms.Buid quality I think is premium because I  have checked out apple buds or any other premium buds yet.

The battery life with case have totally eliminated the dependency on wired earphones. The bass in these is literally ear rattling and I mean it in a good way. Also it's quite some hassel when you use touch control on wireless ear buds if they are not sensitive enough and require you to press them a little hard for the touch to be recognised, and it becomes painful if you use touch very often.But the touch sensitivity in these is next to perfection. The gentlest of touch is enough for it to recognise and that has made all the difference.",5.0

698,Very dissatisfied with the product,"One side earbud had buzzing noise and became very quiet after only a few months. Got a replacement unit and even that too started having the same issues and the left earbuds dies after just 15 minutes of use (without any battery low warning), while the other works for a few hours. Also the volume levels are vastly different for different apps and types of content, unlike other headphones. Music apps are extremely loud, whereas video content is very quiet at the same volume level. Also the connection is lost randomly when you pause the content, but it will still show that it’s connected, so have to disconnect and connect again. This issue happens very frequently.",1.0

700,A really great pair of wireless earphones!,"The Boat Airdope 441 is totally worth every penny. This advanced wireless earphones are classy and come with fully capacitive touch controls. The box comes with 3 pairs of extra ear buds, one charging cable and an user manual. The sound quality is pretty great. The ear pieces fit in snugly into the ears and stay right in place despite a lot of head movement. The microphone is very good and one can easily answer phone calls with the earphones as the sound is clear and crisp. Although personally I did not like the constantly blinking indicators on the earpods, it's hardly a blip in the design. It is overall a great investment.",5.0 
701,I am disappointed... I trusted boat for so long,"It has been an year now that I bought this product.. It was amazing at the beginning and as time progressed, it started to disconnect on its own.

Enjoy the movie and music without any lag or discomfort.4. Only the main drawback for me is fitting problem in my left ear it causes pain in ear after use, i don't know why but left earbud gives a lot of pain in my ear and its a huge  drawback of product and because one can compromise on sound ,battery or looks but without proper fitting no one would go with it as it causes pain in ear.Edit 2 :- after 4.5 months of usage writing again :-it pain a lot in ear after using this earbuds sadly i have wasted my money , because if I'm not comfortable wearing then how can I use it.

I GOT IT FOR RS.2400 DURING PRIME DAY SALE.(NEW LAUNCH).Full review:Pros:1.Main thing is it's battery backup and you can use it as a power bank too. With 2600mah battery powered case , it's the best.2.IPX7 water and sweat resistance makes it superb.3.Even with a 6mm driver, hearing music is a absolute bliss.gives you a awesome bass too.4.Comparing with 441 , this new 441 pro gives you extra battery backup, you can also use this air dopes for attending calls since the microphone is way better than 441.5.The Bluetooth version is 5.0 which is latest so no connectivity problems when the airdopes are near to the connecting device.Cons:1.The touch buttons are so sensitive, you should get used to it.2. The connectivity is poor when the distance between phone and airdopes becomes 6 meters.No other issues are found.

The earbuds themselve work very well for around 5 hours...But wearing these for longer period does hurt my outer ears a little",4.0 
723,Average. Worth the price or not is up to your particular use case.,"Used it for 12 weeks now (3 months) and all I can say is it's a very 'meh' product, extremely mid (average) sound quality, try using equalizer to get better sound quality, I use the Wavelet android app for that. Bass is somewhat acceptable but there is lot of distortion at higher volumes, tune it right and it sounds good. Microphone quality is fine but prone to noise so use it *only if you are indoors* seriously it is impossible for the person on the other end to hear you when you are in a noisy environment. Play/Pause delay is a little too high about 1 second should be somewhere half of that. Double tap to switch tracks took a lot practice to get used to to get it to work accurately even now I fail at it sometimes, this definitely needs improvements as it's somewhat annoying. No swipe volume control. Voice assistant I never use so can't comment.One of the better things is that each ear bud can work independently of the other, i.e you can connect either one of the ear buds without having to connect the other, this is a problem on some other brands like Jabra from what some people have told me. Pairing process was without much issue, but it's a little troubling that the ear buds are always in paring mode after taking it out of the case as someone can just randomly decide to connect to your ear buds if your own device does not connect to it quickly.Battery life of the ear buds is decent, about 4 to 6-ish hours depending on usage. Power-bank functionality is pretty useful helps in a pinch used it a few times. The cases battery is huge compared to the buds so I recharge it once in 2 weeks if I did not use the power bank feature.Comfort is subjective but for me initially I couldn't wear it for longer than 2 hours straight on the left ear and for 1 hour straight on the right ear, but after 2 weeks I got used to them can can wear them for 5+ hours. Sometimes laughing or running around while wearing them causes it to pop out, most likely a 'me' problem.More about the case, there is a cover for the ports so there's some protection for it but the covers flexible plastic hinge may break off if you are not careful when charging it. One thing to be careful about is to charge the case you need to have a USB Type-C cable with a thin casing else you can't insert it properly as the port cover gets in the way, my Amazon Basics Type-C cable does not fit for that very reason. The charging cable provided in the box is pretty flimsy looking and short so don't try to use it with other devices.The size of the case is huge compared to competitors so it looks awkward in some pockets this is mainly because the case is about 3 cms thick at the thickest part, if they could make it a little thinner it wouldn't be as noticeable. I wear jeans and T-shirts so the shirt somewhat hides the massive lump, it definitely won't fit in small pockets so not really suitable for office work environments as it looks awkward in pants even when standing, but this makes sense as a design choice as it seems to be marketed towards young adults (teens -> university students) since they usually use backpacks to carry around stuff.Haven't gotten it wet yet, so I can't comment on the claim of IPX7 splash resistance, I don't exercise while wearing them so can't comment on that either.As with any product treat it right and it will last you quite some time. Overall pretty satisfied with this 'meh' device solely because of the price point.Will update more on battery degradation later, but for now it seems right ear bud lasts a little longer than the left one about 15 mins longer. - 01/02/2022",4.0 
724,Best TWS in range,"This is first TWS after a good research on you tube and on official brand websites.I have been researching about getting a nice TWS earbuds for my everyday use.I wanted a product with great built quality, a decent battery backup and a good sound.The buds are very cool looking with a sleek and stylish recharging case of Active Black color. They are multifunctional buds with decent features packed. We get touch control system which is very active in response even on a slight touch we can see the effective response. The features very easy to use as just by tapping on the touch control, we can access all the controls of the music. And with the same ease we can check the check the charging left in the charging case just by pressing a button on the case.The pairing system is also very smooth. For the first time we just have to pair it with our phone, and then after that whenever we open the charging or carrying case and the bluetooth of the phone is on then automatically they will connect and disconnect after placing in the case and closing it.Pros1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.2. Type C Charging - I use a Samsung galaxy f41 so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. It doesn't feel bulky in the ears.5. Charging can also be used as a mini power bank for emergency (Recommended not to use it as a power bank very often).ConsNot much1. But sometimes automated functions don't work so we have to do them manually.Fix to the cons problemWe can factory reset the buds to remove those problems.And my experience of listening music in crowded place is very good. And the noise isolation they provide is also very good.",5.0 
725,One Change may help !,"Everything is Good- sound, bass, connectivity, touch sensitivity, noise cancellation, charging, battery, case etc. BUT one thing bothers me. When I put on the earbuds I can do anything, walk, run, eat, drive,jump etc. BUT when lay on bed sideways, the capacitive touch of the earbud touching the pillow gets touched and the earbuds get disconnected. so I put on only left side if I lay on  the right and vice-versa. If only this problem could be solved it would be great because not only me, but everybody loves to watch movies or listen songs or talks over phone while laying on bed.  Otherwise the earbuds are very very good.",4.0 
726,Worth buying,Thw aound quality is totally amazing and we have really great experience while watching YouTube & movies.

727,Worst experience. Buy at your own risk,"I bought this product in March. The sound quality, bass was great. They were really comfortable. But after 5-6 months, suddenly the left side pod started discharging within 10-15 minutes.My brother also had bought this product one month earlier and he too started facing the problem within the same time frame. The worst part is my product is under warranty but there are not Enough service centers and those that you can find on Boat's official site, half of them don't pick up your phone or are dysfunctional.It's really disappointing to have this problem in such a reputed brand. And you can see other reviews, many seem to be facing the same issue after some time. Waste of money!",1.0 
728,HONESTLY SPEAKING PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.,It costs ₹2499/- while buying this Boat Airdope 441pro (active black).Sound quality is average. Ear started to feel pain after 3 hrs of usage. Noise cancellation is decent. Microphone doesn't work well if you are traveling or in a room under celling fan (full speed)I bought this product 31st October 2020. And it's now 10th October 2021.  I had to send this product to Boat's service center for two times within  this 9 months of usage. Both the times 10 days (×2) got wasted in this (receiving- servicing- delivering) process.The main issue was malfunctioning. After first 4 months of usage battery of left ear started to drain out to 0% within 2hrs meanwhile right ear still at 80% battery level.So I reported my issue at Boat suport online website. They mailed me back and accepted my request for servicing. It took 10 days and they replaced my product (because it was within my warrenty period)Again after around 3 months of usage same malfunctioning occurs and this time same battery drained faster in my right ear. While my left ear was at 80% battery level.Again reported my issue and they replaced the product and it took 10 days again.Now it's almost near the end of my warrenty period. I don't know if same thing happens again then I will have to live with that faulty product.THOSE WHO ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT PLEASE THINK BEFORE BUYING IT.Better go with some other wired earphones that will provide better experience and costs less money.,2.0

731,Review after 15 days,"Writing this after 15 days of use.Pros: Fit in the ears is nice. Not bulky that you will have to be constantly guarded that the airpods will fall off.Gets paired easily without much hassels.Battery backup - Used for little over 3 hrs at a stretch and didn't have to put the airpods in the charging box.Cons: Not ideal for calls. The calls get connected but there will be moments when the airpods skip / jump seamless connection. The other end of your caller will ask you to repeat as they missed hearing few words.After 2 to 2.5 hrs of use, your ears drums feel closed as the fit is so perfect deep into the ear canal.

732,BOAT Airdopes 441: Fantastic Purchase,"I bought these yesterday & I've been using them ever since. Got it in a single day! Amazon really outdid itself.The airdopes are excellent. Especially with my phone, no complaints!However I tried using them with my laptop & realised that using bluetooth earbuds with hotspot is not feasible.I used them with my smart tv & they work incredibly well.I am very happy with my purchase & would recommend them to anyone who is keen on trying wireless earbuds.",5.0 
733,Pleasantly Surprised!,"First off, let me tell you that my primary headphones are Skullcandy Crushers Wireless, so you can just imagine my expectations of ""bass"" and overall sound quality in earphones/headphones; quite honestly, it has spoiled me and ruined all other options as nothing really gets me going like them monsters ( i like my music bassy, without sever compromise on clarity ofcourse).I ordered this for casual use outdoors after a lot of research for bassy earbuds (my first boAt product), and this one popped up consistently in all reviews and suggestions. Having negligible hopes, I was all prepared to be underwhelmed...BUT boy oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised by these, almost a smile on my face in first couple of songs - quite a big  achievement in my books.The bass makes it's presence felt prominently, without severely overshadowing the vocals - so the mids are fairly good; although the highs are a little damp. That being said, the sounds output in general is reasonably clear considering the price point (bang for the buck honestly). If you want neutral sounding earbuds, look elsewhere as these are only going to please people who like their music ""flavored""Take a bow boAt..",4.0 
734,"Not up to the mark, even when compared to their own products.","I frankly had initial reservation while purchasing this product, so no hard feelings. But this proves why products that have a better QA team are always better, which also justifies their higher cost.I have been using this product for 8 months now.1. The sound quality is not good, bass looks artificial, sometime sounding like old cassette tape when it used to get stuck or play slowly.2. The shrillness in the voice is all over the place, no consistency there.3. There is a good lag in sound and voice delivery, the lag is clearly noticeable.4. Within 8 months the upper charging pin of right earbud has got recessed. So the charging is not consistent now.Bottom line, if you can afford to spend more, go for more established brands. Even if you are budget constrained, go for other cheaper brands, as currently the there is absolutely no difference.P.S. this reciew is only for airdopes and not boAt. I have many of their products, and for the money they charged, those gave a satisfactory performance.",2.0

Overall it a good product if u r looking for just music lisening but for call it's a bad choice.",3.0 
743,"""THEY ARE MY NEW EARS""","I bought this pair of TWS for gyming purpose. And guys this is the best one for gym, it doesn't fall from your ear. Make sure that you put the earphones in your respective pic. See my pic to understand the figure of the earphones when put on the ear. READ THE MANUAL BEFORE USING IT. Buy the BLACK ONE, it's classy and doesn't look cheap. I ordered YELLOW first but it looked like roadside product, not that bad tho. LOL. Then, I replaced it with BLACK.Pros:1. Mind-Blasting Bass. Just AMAZED.2. Perfectly fits. (YES, for gyming)3. 1 year warranty.4. It connects to your device SUPER FAST. FASTER THAN LIGHT MAYBE.5. Lightweight.6. Music Chores are also amazing.7. Type C charger is the best. The case gets full charged just in 1-2 hours.8. And last but not least it's an INDIAN brand.Cons:-1. Many people say that it's mic is bad and call quality is bad. I don't have a girlfriend so there's no need for me to talk on call😂😂LOL. But it's not that bad. MANAGEABLE.Will tell ya after using for some time. Until no cons.JUST BUY IT DONT THINK TOO MUCH. ITS THE BEST.",5.0 
744,Review after using it for a month,"What I liked about the product is its quality looking at the price range. For this price range, it does a fabulous job. Good bass, sound quality, can receive calls clearly, listen to music, almost everything I expected in this price.What I disliked about the product is its sensors are on the surface of the bud. Everytime I touch it for placing it properly in my ear, the call gets disconnected. Or the video gets paused.  I cannot sleep on my side on my pillow with both earbuds as the sensor touch gets activated and my video is paused. I am using the smallest ear size of the extra buds given. Otherwise it's a gud product.",4.0 
745,Superb Earpods,"Very good earpods when compared to other products available in the market with the same price. Bass quality is superb. However there is little trouble while talking using these earbuds, noise cancellation is not upto the mark.",5.0 
746,Not at all a good choice,"I'm using these since 24-Nov.1. Right unit is highly unstable. Many times only left unit is functional. Right unit doesn't connect at all or disconnects frequently. Thus listening music becomes an irritation; not enjoyment.2. Microphone doesn't work at all. I've to use my laptop's microphone for office calls. This makes them completely useless for office work.3. I've not used them for phone calls.Looking at #1 and #2, two of three basic purposes of using BT headsets are shattered. I'll not recommend these to any body.",2.0 
747,Good one,"I predominantly use while exercising. It doesnt fall of from my ears, which is a really boon, and I do all sorts of HIIT and Cardio involving jumps and running. I dont use it for calling. Only con is after an hour of use I get pain in my ears which may be due to incorrect size of ear buds in headset. Otherwise all good.",5.0 
748,could have been better,"It's an alright earpod. Could have been better, this was a gift. The person who uses it puts a helmet on when riding bike, on top of this earpod...and it shuts off. The touch responds to not only human hands but to anything that touches it. So the touch ruined the experience, otherwise it's probably fine",3.0

750,Based on battery backup think before buying..!!,"Sound and Bass Quality good but Noise Cancellation not up to mark. And most observed that the right earphone won't sit properly sometimes and even battery back is also not good like an example I used airdopes morning hardly 1 hour and then kept in box as usual and guess what when I used airdopes at it gave battery backup of hardly 3 and half hours only then giving sound battery low l. What a waste on money in this product, I didn't expect such thing from boat being I'm lover of boat as I'm having two headphones 2016 model and 2018 model too and speaker 2018 model. But airdopes didn't met my expectations as I thought in terms of battery backup such waste of money. Rather I would have bought same model with less battery backup than more money on high battery backup.",4.0 
751,Average product from Boat. Nothing pro about it.,"Yet another average boat product.This is my 4th boat product and I'm super disappointed that they don't work well with Laptops.In the current scheme of things most people are looking for work-from-home equipments that work well with a standard windows laptop. The audio quality is terrible when using these on calls via MS Teams. The touch is super sensitive and that makes it unviable for workouts and outdoors. Cos no headphones will stick in your ear perfectly while running/jogging or playing or doing cardio. You may end up touching them to set them right in your ear. And the moment you do that, they disconnect or stop the music or one of them stops working.Initially I thought it was a faulty product but the same issue persists with the replacement I received from Amazon.I am officially never buying Boat products again.",3.0 
752,Not worth buying this,"following are the problems that i am facing after just 1 month of usage:1. The left earbud suddenly stops working. Putting it back in the case won't restart it. No matter how much you try, it won't pair and start. Have to put it outside the case to get it's charge completely drained off and then charge it again. Cannot rely on these for your journeys or even day to day chores.2. The sound gets distorted even when the phone is in your pockets.3. The charge won't last for an entire movie. So you start watching with these eardopes and end with a regular earphone.4. Have to try to get both the eardopes connected to your device in multiple attempts by turning on and off your bluetooth as many times only one side of the eardopes gets connected to the devices.",1.0 
753,Sound quality is surprisingly good with adequate base..,"The sound quality was good.. infact more than I expected.. truly .. bcoz generally with boat products they tend to lean to more bass, however it was not the case here. Maybe due to wireless the base is just correct.. for the price this is unbeatable.. ❤️💗🌼",5.0 
754,"Very good sound quality, comfort grip. You should definitely go for it.","I received this product before the delivery time. That's a plus point. And most of all, it's sound quality is outstanding. I was previously using Realme Buds Q but they were literally a waste of money. When you switch to Airdopes 441, you really get a mesmerizing experience.First of all, talking about its sound quality, it is very very good and It provides a very good bass. Talking about its design, it may seem a little too ordinary regarding the price but it is good. The extra wings on the side of the buds provides a firm grip so they don't dall off easily and do not fall form the ears even while doing heavy exercise. It also provides an IPX 6 rating. Moreover, it comes with a Type C charging case which is a plus point.So, if you're looking for earbuds within a price range of 2000 to 2500, it is the best. Go for it.",5.0 
755,worst airpod,"I got this Boat airpod 441 Pro on 15th June & when I used it for my zoom meeting the very first day, suddenly the voice started to have a lots of disturbance in middle of the meeting, then I changed to the other airpod which also went on for a few minutes then it also started to have the same disturbance. After that till next 2 days it was working fine, but now i.e. on 18 June it just didn't connect after taking the airpod (both) out of the box and was not connecting for almost 20-25 minutes, switched in on & off many times so that it would connect immedaite after switching it on, but to my disappointment it Didnt.... After this when I was again trying, it just got unpaired automatically....This is not how an airpod should function. I would rather give Negative to this product.On top of all this, there is error in returning the products and even amazon is not accepting the same & after going through all the IVR chats, this also automatically disconnects and ask to restart on the IVR questions again. Dont expect this from AMAZON.  I would rather term Boat Airpod 441 Pro worst airpod ever.",1.0

But if your product fails 2-3 times within a year and you have to get it replaced remotely and lose almost 2-3 months without using the product what good is the product in the first place?This clearly makes BoAt products highly suceptable to failure within warranty and buying time within Waranty period through the replacement is just simple solution for them.Unreliable and waste of purchase is how I'd put in one line.",1.0

But if ur like a hardcore user who uses it for more hrs than its is not at all good!it just hardly survives 3 hrs (2.5/5 battery backup)2)and Ya for gamers this is not at all a choice if ur going to buy these wont recognize the enemy footsteps in the right and left and all it just messes up the sound in the game and also u will feel frame drops if u use this airdopes connected to ur phone through Bluetooth! (for gaming0.5/6) 0.5 bcoz atleast sound is coming yet 😅Ya and finally if ur using these for ur normal song sessions workout sessions than go for it 5/5But if u guys are using these to watch movies series and play games plz don't go for these for movies and series consider the battery backup..for gamers it's just a waste it just drops frames if connected to ur game!",2.0

Constant loud enough hissing while making phone calls.Bass is decent music quality is good i would say but when u listening to music the hissing sound is suppressed but in call u can hear it constantly and its damn annoying. When watching movie there are gaps in dialogue and the hissing takes the immersion of the movie completely awayIf there is no sound to play hissing continues for 3 4 secs to ruine any momentTLDR; dont go with rating. dont buy it. Its really bad. Sound quality doesnt mean anything when it ruines moment of immersion. Many buyers had complained but i thought maybe they got a bad piece since so many positive reviews and i was dead wrong, i already had the replacement and exactly same issue. its the fault of device design.

Also it's kinda irritating during calls so I'll be returning them unfortunately. If that was not the case I believe they would have been quite nice.Edit: It got replaced the next day but the new ones have the same problem. Guess it's a flaw in this particular model.  Will try to refund again (idk if it's possible second time, I'm doing this for the very first time). Also now I've changed the ratings from 3 to 2 stars.

Good for music in this price range.4. Solid( I have dropped some time but nothing happened)Cons -1. Voice quality on call is not good , people I call complain that is looks like echo sound as if I am in a small room. I compared it with my boult neckband and really it was terrific.2. Noise cancellation is the most disappointing factor, even in cycling the air sound is so much that my voice is not clear ( you can’t hear anything) then forget about bike. I was in canteen and told to my friend to record the call, when I heard it ,I was not  able to get any of my word.3. They are in ear type , So they fit to your ear and seal the ear canal , so I hear my own voice While talking and it’s frustrating, may be it happens to every tws but with this I can’t use both the ear piece. I usually use one of them otherwise I hear my own body movements , I can hear my steps during walk internally .4.no  Volume Adjustment. Though I dint feel any prob with this5. If you are laying down in bed due to the touch by ear your call may disconnect sometime. ( don’t know this is prob or not but it happens with me sometimes)6.

792,Good for music. Not that good for calls.,"I have been using this product for almost a week. My review is divided into 3 parts. music , calls & Battery life.1) Music: I have noticed that the sound quality is decent. I would say that the bass is not too high as per my previous experience with boat. It's nicely tuned. The lows are nice than they used to be. The high pitch notes are little bassy when you tune your volume little high.2) Calls: Works well for most telephone/whatsapp calls. When I use this for online calls with video conference like Google Meet, the audio starts to crack. I don't think it's a connection issue as I have a pretty fast connection for a household. So the issue could be with the earphones itself. Other than that I don't have any issue with this.3) Charge: Looks decent as of now. On 90% I roughly use it for an hour or two and see that I will have some where around 50-60% left. I haven't tested the full single charge test nor the entire capacity of the charging case as I don't use it continuously. Will update once done.Final verdict. Decent buy as I got it for Rs:1800. Any thing more you might have to look for alternatives.",4.0

796,It's designed to cover up for complete noise cancellation so avoid while on roads,The sound quality is good. the charge also keeps up as saying its closeout full noise differs from the size of the earDue to its coverup or closing ear completely. not recommended for the road while walking it's like the ear went deaf unless the music off no outside voice bass quality is also good,4.0 
797,Touch sensitive is too sensitive,"Sound’s great. Noise cancellation is on point and bass, is fantastic!The touch sensitive system is a little irritative as whenever you take out the airdopes either from the ear or the case, accidental touch plays music automatically on device.Look wise, the lights on the airdopes are a little cheap looking, but, you won’t believe what you’re getting at this price!",4.0 
798,Right side Eardope stopped charging after 4 Months.,"Overall the product is great and Sound quality is awesome as I used for 4 months.I really loved this BoAt AirDopes 441 but I am sorry to say that after using it for 4 months the right side Airdope stopped charging and can't use it now.Actually, the Brand is from India but Made in PRC(China) and Electronics things don't last long and can't predict when they die.So Guys, one advice -  please think before buying",1.0 
799,Awesome product in this price range.......totally promicing! ❤,This is my first airdopes after just returned 311v2.....this is much much better in all ways..... And the most amezing part is secure fit and comfort ...... After continue using 3 hours there is no pain or hedeche and battery backup is also good around 4-4.5 hours and bass is enough not too much which cause hedeche. Design is awesome and magnetic case with matt finish looks really good and the colourfull lighting during charging or playing increses the facination and coolness of tge pods....... If you wanna buy a promicing and quality product in 2-2.5k range you can definitely go for it without any doubt.,5.0

803,Sound Quality is good but it will give only 4-5 hours  playtime for every time charging.,Pros:Customer service was good Becoz after one week of using I got problem with airpods like one side is not working and also not connecting to bluetooth so they took responsibility and  exchanged the product without any delivery fee.We can charge the phones but please don't tryYou can avoid the headphones wires for sometime  which will annoy and makes impossible to move from the place.Airpods takes 2 hours to charge and gives the 4-5 hours playtime maximum and sometimes not.Good fit in the ears - No problemCons:Not so good bass qualityNot so good Noise cancellationNot so good soundNot so good productNot so good experience for 2699Not connecting to bluetooth after one week and also one earbud problem.Not giving the playback time 150H with charging case (i.e 80H only)Don't use it for charging the phones bcoz it will degrade the performanceNot for those who uses airpods more hoursOverall experience was below average,5.0

808,"Not worth it. If you're going to buy, be ready to compromise.",This is a nice product so far .The quality of product is pretty good you will get soft plastics .The sound quality is also good especially for bass lovers .The only thing which seem to be missing is the volume adjustment which is not provided in the buds but this do not seem to be a big issue as such.you can use this for hearing music as well as to attend calls seamlessly .Great product from boat,2.0 
809,Catches the eye,"I got this buds delivered two days back and used it to the max to check how much its worth. Below are findings..Pros:1. Sound is pretty good, but i feel the bass is little boosted.2. I like the mic noise cancelling, it cuts the background noise (like air, fan and some little noises), i tried while riding my bike, buds mic catches bike motor sounds. So, perfect for home environment.3. Battery backup was good, it got the full potential of 35mAh in both the buds which long for 4 and half hours4. Box battery 2600mAh can charge buds for more than 20 times.5. Charging time for the buds from Oop’s battery low to full is 1hr 15 minutes.6. These buds cant remember or recognise last paired if you keep changed with devices7. Bluetooth range is good, i connected these to my smart tv and can still listen even though tv is 10 meters away. (Two rooms between)8. Just slips into your pocket, but its a little big. (We should compromise battery life with the size and weight of the box)Cons:1. Yes, there is a buzzy sound in the left bud, which gets a bit low while you are listening something and gets a bit high when you pause the audio.2. Buds are little uncomfortable, they are big for me even with the small size bud caps.3. Buds battery life is fine, but case battery is not as promising as said (150hours approximate 30 charges)4. Keeps disconnecting when i try to connect these to my laptopGot these in sale for ₹2,499",5.0 
810,Worth for Money!,"Never expected this kinda quality in this price!Bought this 3 months ago.Sound quality is really awesome. Even the voice call clarity is great. Sound Effects - No questions! It's Boat, pal. Bass quality is wonderful comparing to other product. Noise cancellation is OK.Battery backup - If we use continuously for listening music or watching movie, it will last for 5 hrs.Charging - Time taking to charge the case upto 3 to 4 hrs and the Airdopes will take less than half an hour to get fully charged when you kept it inside the case.Touch Responsive is superb. Till now working good.The only demerit that I found is, if I use it for long time (above 4 hrs) then my right ear starting to feel a mild pain.So, I'm giving overall rating 4/5.",4.0 
811,The product became malfunctioned within 10 days of purchase.,"Worst Product!! 😡😡 Don't buy it at all.Usually I don't write any review of the product but this product cost me so much trouble that it is worth mentioning. I brought BOAT AIRDOPES 441 PRO(SPORTY BLUE),the sound in the Right Earpiece got diminished within 10 days of buying the product.So I claimed warranty service from BOAT. They got the product replaced but the procedure is so hectic that it almost took 1 month to get replaced. After using it for another 2-3 months the same problem began to rise but this time in both the earpieces.I got so annoyed that I stopped using the product. After few days I again claimed warranty service( since it of 1 year manufacturer warranty) and the process is still going on.I am surprised that such a terrible product is sold by such a reputed company like BOAT.By the way other features like sound quality,noice cancellation and bass quality is OK and upto the mark.",1.0

813,It compromises treble over bass,"It's good for phone calls and podcasts but I wouldn't suggest this for music. I've noticed this problem with a few earphones before. The Bass is so much that all the other parts are somewhat muffled. You cannot listen to what the Music Producers actually composed the songs to be like.But the packaging, look and style is very good. It also fits well to your ear.",3.0

815,"Boat Airdopes 441 - Not bad, not good","Bought the Boat 441 Airdopes for ₹1999/- (Prime day Sale)This is my first pair of TWS earbuds, so I dont have anything to compare it with although the following review entails my experience as a user :Pros-1. Noise cancellation is amazing! Active and passive, both.2. The bass quality is really good too, and I found instrumental separation good on listening to some music.Cons-1. Despite changing the earbuds and the wing to the smallest size, it hurts after wearing these airdopes after just half an hour. Ultimately, I removed the wings and that fits much better but makes it more easy to drop these tiny tiny airdopes2. The CTC takes some time to get used to, there's a lag between touching the sensor and the song getting paused/changed.3. My airdopes spontaneously disconnected a number of times.4. (The worst of all) - there's a sort of buzzing noise in the left airdope. I'm sure it must be a problem with mine but it's still disheartening to have spent 2000 rupees on technology that fails you. (I have placed a replace request)All in all, these are a good pair of earphones to own but since it's a very subjective feeling of fit and comfort, you will have to be careful while using them and making the decision whether you like them or not.",4.0 
816,Only go for bass,"Everything is perfect except loudness of sound, because bass overshadowed the quality of sound ( mid, low, highs ), and output is 70 % bass, i like the balanced sound of Ptron Urban, though it is far cheaper than boat 441. So if you are bass fan, go for boat 441, otherwise choose another one, which delivers balanced sound like oppo enco w11. Rest is your choice",4.0

821,Purchase at your own risk!,"Review of boAt Airdopes 441 TWS:I had ordered the Airdopes on 29th October, 2020.To be honest the sound was not that good. Also the touch response was laggy.After 2 months,  left ear-drop stopped charging so I registered a complaint. Please note that it took about 15 days to get the product replaced. Also, they don't claim to replace the product with new Airdropes; most of the times it's refurbished.  *Do read their warranty policy before making purchases of any of the Boat's products.To my surprise the sound quality of the replaced unit was better than the previous unit; That means they don't have quality control and every airdrop sounds different.  But obvious the product is made in China.After 10 days of usage again the Airdropes started to sound weird. The sound from the left Airdrop sounded low and muddy; the right one produced buzzing sound when nothing was played.Have initiated the replacement process, but till date haven't received the replacement.I generally never write reviews; but writing this review so that others can make informed decisions while purchasing any of Boat product.After all, it's your money and your decision.Peace!!!",2.0 
822,Honest review after using 2 months.,"So, basically at the starting they seems to be working quite good.1) after 2 weeks, the left earbud started making chhhrrrrr- chhhrrrrrrr sound.2) The noise cancellation is just for fun, because there is no noise cancellation in it and when you talk on a call the person on other side is not able to listen you and you have to disconnect it.3) The ear buds do not fits correctly in the charging case. You have to make the adjustment for ear buds to connect with the case and then charge.4)build quality is just awesome.5) The multi colour lights in it make it look very cheap.6) Literally this one is so Important, Your ears are gonna pain like hell if you wear them more then 20 mins. My ears feels so much pain, seriously This is one of the big problem in it.Now It's your choice. You should buy these or not.😊",1.0 
823,Not worth the money.. audio too low and call quality bad,"I purchased the Boat 441 airdopes and found them to be a waste of money.First things first, the packaging, the headphones and the charging box look to be of good build and quality. But that's just about as good as it gets.The volume is extremely low, and call quality is bad too with the person on the other end not able to hear anything or hears lots of distortions. The calls audio quality at my end is good (though very low volume).. till about 70% of the total volume, the quality is average and could barely hear.. it gets better at near full volume.The worst part is Amazon does not support return for this product and only offers an exchange.  I will update should my experience be any better with the exchanged product.",2.0 
824,One of the best TWS I have used till date,"I bought this CSK edition because I am a huge fan of MSD.The pros are 1. They are portable and fits within a palm2. They give sufficient battery backup to last an entire trip3. They do not get scratched easily and the colour will last4. Excellent customer care service: after 3 months, I asked for exchange because one of the buds was not working so they replaced it within a span of 7-8 days5. It will not fall during heavy workoutThe cons are 1. In my POV, the bass on 90% or 100% seems not to work properly.Giving review after using it for 100 days.

828,Scared the shiit out of me,"First day- when i started using them I loved them like they r awesome but in the evening when I was listening to a song I don't know what happened the song was breaking so I stopped the music and played it again( I was scared that is a faulty product) but it was working well happened once#second day- when I removed the earbuds from the case the left one didn't connect to the right so put them back in the case and closed it and tried to connect it again n they did connect got scared n started search on YouTube of boat airdopes 441 problems so there they said reset it so I did was working fine#third day-went for cycling and noticed that they were breaking the song again . I was thinking to return it next day but then I did reset again n went to hoping it becomes fine tomorrow#fourth day- they were working fine big relief no such issue after that work absolutely fine I guess they were packed for so many time maybe needed so time to get use toPros:- (good bass at 90% if u listen on 100% bass overpowers)👈(wrote this a month after using)(wrote 👉 after using for 7months I don't feel they are overpowered on the bass side now they feel equal or perfect To be precise) and also the loudness depends on the apps you use for listening songs on wynk is good in loudness and bass but Spotify the loudness is not that much2) connectivity- they connect very quickly like no joke really quick3) touch is awesome need some time though to get used to it4)calling is great in house didn't tried it outsideCons:-I don't think so there r any(Will let u know if I face any problem in future. I am scared of those two things that happened in the beginning I hope they don't happen againREVIEW AFTER 7 MONTHS OF USEWork properly but rarely becomes disconnects walking out side at crowded places and once a month while using at home . Water proof is for sure ,got a bit wet while using but they were working normal no issue but there is a problem but it's a minor one I guess sometimes they don't charge full like if I put the earbuds in the case before sleeping n when using in the morning they show 90% charged even when they are in the case over night but when they are placed properly they charge and battery life is also top notch only if they worked on the the quality of the case it would be awesome but still it is a good choice",4.0 
829,Waste of money. Better buy boat rockerz 225 or bassheads 255,"I'm diehard fan of boat. I have positive opinion after reading review on boat airdopes.I'm writing review after using it 20 days.1.Initially bluetooth connection worked around 5 to 6 meters. Now it is limited max 3 meters. If you move moretham 3 meters from device connection will break.2. Both airdopes are working fine if bluetoothcharging is 100%. Right side dope is not working if the charging is 80%. Battery back up also not coming more than 2 hours.3. Not comfortable to make calls. You have to speak very loudly to reach your voice others. Touch is very sensitive. Even if ear pressure is there, then your call will disconnect. If you adjust airdope when you are on call, call will disconnect for sure.4.audio and bass quality also not good compared to boat rockerz.So please think wisely and don't get suffered after purchased it.",1.0

841,"Nice earbuds, a steal deal at rs 2000 but made in PRC","This is going to be a detailed review so please read it carefully :I was using my wired earphones and thought of upgrading and so I bought this earbuds during winter sale for rs2000.Pros:-1. The case has a matte finish which looks very good and due to its pebble design it's easy to hold.2. It has a type c port which is helpful as all the smartphones now come with a type c port so you don't have to search your cable again and again.3. The earbuds are completely made up of plastic and so are lightweight.4. The fins on each of the earbud is very helpful as it prevents the buds from falling. I did various exercises and running and they don't fall out.5. Battery life is quite decent on the earbuds. They last upto 3 and 1/2 hours on 60% to 70% volume. The battery backup on the case is really good. I was able to charge the buds 5 times with the case from 0 to 100%.6. The base is very good and punchy which made it sound better.Cons:-1. At this price range they could provide more battery on the buds.2. Due to the small size of the drivers the volume is low. You have to keep it at 70% to listen clearly.3. The sound is not well balanced, it is shifted more towards the base.4. The ears start paining after a long term usage but you will get a hang of it after a while. Also there's an extra fin available which is smaller than the pre installed one so you can switch to it as it's more comfortable (it may depend).5. The hinge on the case is a little bit fragile so use it carefully.6. The product is made in china although boat is a indian brand.At last I would say that at this price range it's a good pair of buds.",4.0

Fits perfectly in the ear.4. Looks premium.5. Connecting with phone is flawless and also pause, play, next song option on earpod is great.Cons:1. My left earpod had some tingling noise when video is playing but volume is low or zero. This was really irritating and I replaced the earpods. The replacement one were better.2. The biggest Con I came across is, this does not work during live video calls... E.g. Zoom meetings. The zoom meeting gets stuck, voice is not heard and simply staggers the audio&video. Once I disconnected the earpod the zoom meeting was back to normal. I tried this multiple times. Not sure if earpods are not meant to work for live video calls, but this one does not seem to work.",4.0

847,Excellent 😍 but not awesome 😔,"Giving review after 10 days of using. Nice product. Battery life is awesome 🤩 but using only one airdope and replacing other 😅 over a time. No volume control 😠. Touch is so sensitive as just a slight touch will end the call which makes us feel uncomfortable. Excellent for gaming any kind of games especially for PUBG lovers 😍. Material used for airpodes is so nice as accidentally I dropped by airpode from 1st floor to ground floor which directly fallen on the Road, but aftet using it it worked nicely no problem in hearing and no scratches and no cracks which makes me happy about airdopes. 2600 mah battery is so nice which makes us to take any were going out not bothering about of charging and current cuts. For music lovers also it is so good with good bass but not excellent. If u are music lover and listen most of the time they are excellent as they give more battery life by managing the airpodes using two for some time and keeping one airpode for charging. Overall it is very good product with excellent battery life, Good bass, Good Long range bluetooth connection, Very good quality of product. But only problem is No volume control 🙄😡.",5.0 
848,Overall..it's good product at this price..and it connects easily to any BT device..,"Bass quality is not that gr8...it's like normal ear phone..u can get such quality in every ear phone of up to 500 rs..Noise cancellation is almost not working in this ear buds..the other person can clearly hear the surrounding noise even if u r on bike, the person can hear air passing sound..overall the sound quality is ok...but I really liked the touch system, lighting and it's adaptation to ear.. built quality is really good and tough even if it fall from25 feet, it works perfectly without any damages to ear bud,,u can buy at this price..",4.0 
849,Its cheap and can't expect a lot more from this .. !!,i Got the headphones just as an alternative to my bose Sound sports of course i am probably comparing them to those but the volume in these headsets are just not there .. There are times that i go for long cycling rides and i require more than a pair of wireless headsets to keep me going for longer so as a secondary i bought these. The build is obviously cheap and not that great i recommend if you can spend a little more to go in for the Jabra Elite 65t @ 5999 they are a 100 times better and almost the same quality as the bose .. so make your choice 3k more for the jabra..,2.0 
850,Good sound quality bad mic quality,Pros:1. Product is good for listening songs or watching movie.2. Connectivity is very fast.Cons:1. For phone calls. It's not good as you can't talk on it outdoor as it has too noise and person on another side barely hears you.2. Voice breaks often on call. Can only use in a peaceful place or small room.3. Battery of earphone dies in less than an hour whipe on call.4. While playing music earphone dies in less than 1.5 hours5. Not for playing PUBG as voice lags by 2-3 seconds.,3.0 
851,Worth every penny,"A perfect buy... For some days so many people told me not to buy this one...but after using it I can tell you all that this is one of the best products in the market. It may not have a big brand name like Sony, JBL, Bose, Sennenheiser in its category but worthy... And at this price range its awesome. Thank you Amazon, Thank you Boat.. Keep the quality assured.",5.0 
852,These airdopes are the best in this price segment,Sound quality is amazing and I love the bass in my airdopes 441 I ordered pro model first but the bass quality is doesn't meet the normal 441 I don't know what the company brought with 441 pro other than just battery...and most imp thing is 441 pro model has less battery in buds than normal 441 ..pro had 35 mah and normal 441 has 43 mah...so you get most out of your buds ...Pro model case is big little difficult to handle....I don't about you all...But for me battery is not a problem...Sound quality is imp for me...in 441 airdopes I felt I was in out of this world in 441 pro that feel is missing..Don't you think comfort and feel is more imp than batteryIf you are like me go with just 441,5.0 
853,Robust but sound quality could have been better,Given 4 star as fell from my balcony at 18floor and working 😂. Otherwise just an okay product. Sound quality just okay not impressive. While listening to music there no background noise however if you are on calls then other person will hear your background noise more louder than your voice that's one drawback. Otherwise worth in that amount,4.0 
854,Bang for the Buck,"Purchase 3 no.s. for all my family members. Fits perfect Galaxy Ear buds rubber grip (Ear grip that comes within box feels bit cheaper) Sound Qulity and Bass effect at its best. Since I'm using 2 pairs, no issues with Battery Backup.Only issue is that, at low battery when I try to keep the buds inside the case, it's not getting auto unpaired with device (remains connected even while chrging inside case)The Automatic Pair/Unpair is not that intuitive as compared to Galaxy Buds. But for this price range, exceeded all my expectations.",5.0 
855,Disappointed,"Sound and bass is fine.But i am disappointed as initially i was given different model which was not working. Now when I got replacement with 441 model, its mike is not working properly. Receiver receives the echo. It seems that its obesrving the mike of my phone only. Really disappointed. I feel like I made a mistake purchasing this product",1.0 
856,Painfully bad sound quality.,"First of all, it was mighty hard to set up, they have tried to riddle the product with useless features, and because there are A LOT of them, it gets hard to set it up and even harder to remember. Second of all, the primary feature (sound quality) seems to have received ZERO attention from boAt. It is evident since the sound quality is downright AWFUL. Local wired earphones priced from 100-200 rupees, sound way better.TL;DR: Don't buy this product.",1.0 
857,Very good 👍,Received it today. So used only 1 day. Initial impressions are very good.I baught it for my dad. I use crossbeats pebble.boAt 441 seems very good. Bass quality is amazing.

858,Great bass.. Worth for money. Just go for it.,"The bass quality is awesome. The sound is too good for this price range and we can feel each and every beat. Only con is the feather attached to the buds (added for the purpose of the buds not being fallen easily). It causes slight pain in the ears when we wear the buds too much time. (PS: THIS CAN BE ROMOVED IF WE WANT). Apart from this, these earbuds are worth for money.. Just go for it.",4.0 
859,Never ordering from Boat again!,"I am extremely disappointed with Boat and Amazon. I didn't expect to return the earphones due to a buzzing in the left earpiece, just to receive another set with an even worse buzzing in the left earpiece again! I am never buying any Boat products again, as this is the third time I've received bad quality products from them. Also, I am extremely dissatisfied with Amazon's supposed quality control. If a multi-billion dollar company like this cannot handle vendors that provide bad quality products (despite multiple customer complaints on the same issue), then it's better for me to take my business elsewhere!",1.0 
860,Product is not up to the mark,"I have purchased this product on 15th January and after a week the Airdopes got stop working. So Amazon is not accepted after 7 days policy. Hence I have contacted to Boat customer care and raised ticket. Product has sent to customer care for fix the issue. Its almost 12 days but still the product is not yet returned.My overall review is ""zero"" why because I have purchased Boat rockerz 400 and boat storm 170 I am very happy with that products because those are non touch based products. here boat airpodes are touch based and boat is not up to the mark to maintain quality touch based products",1.0 
861,Awesome Airdopes 441 & 441 pro,"Great product, I didn’t expect these sought of quality product from an Indian company. Much better than apple’s and JBL wired headphones which I was using. Sound quality and Bass quality is awesome. Had to return 1st product due to some issue with charging. Then 2nd product received, is working without any issue. Later I brought 441 pro which again smashed my belief with its power bank facility included with the box and 2600 mAh battery case means only need to charge less frequently compared to 441. Visual battery charge indication in battery case is pretty useful. Sound quality of 441 pro is same as 441.",5.0 
862,Not Recommended,"When I connect it with the laptop, the connection seems to be breaking, there is a disturbance, I need to reconnect again then it starts working again, if you are thinking of using this as a Mic as well you will be disappointed because another person can't hear you. Other than that your ears will experience pain if you use it for more than 1 hour.Overall I would not recommend this, sound quality is good though.",3.0 
863,Honest review: Sound is ok but doesn’t feel comfortable,"So I bought this airdopes for iPhone because spending 12-13k on AirPods is not a good idea, after all , in my case, karni toh mujhe zoom meetings hi hai...Toh the thing is, it looks good, dikhne mein accha hai, sound quality bhi thik-thak hai but your ears can’t take it for more than 10 minutes, 10 minutes mein toh bhaisaab ears pain karne lagte hai.",4.0

865,"Best for 1799, you can go for it.","Pro's : super sound, good volume, doesn't get distorted at high vol, good thumping bass.Easy pair, easily you'll get through a day with just buds, and case is a plus, very handy case, super sleek with elegant classy look. I bought bumblebee yellow, its awesome. Got it in prime day at 1799.Cons : my ears are small, so it doesn't fit in properly, but however it fits now, whatever i do, it doesn't drop, testing jumping, running, skipping many times.One more is, the silicon buds pack your ear and creates pressure in your ear which will feel somewhat uncomfortable after few mins of wearing. The case cap is a bit loose, but you can live with it.Rest i found it worth the money. Sound is amazing, no hissing sound, crystal clear when nothing is playing. It is a good buy.",5.0

869,The built quality is a bit disappointing compared to the 441s.,Even though the product is worth the money but I would to address this particular issue with Airdopes 441 & 441 pro series that one of the bud will either stop charging after a couple uses or it will stop holding enough charge to run for long periods.If they can come up with a good solution to this it will be the best choice in the price range.I have been using the 441 for over a year now but due to the above mentioned problem I had to buy the new ones the 441 pro but to my dismay they also had the same problem just after using for 2 days.If the problem continues I might think of changing my preferences and moving on to find a product that is worth the money I am paying.,3.0 
870,Not good for calling,"The quality of the product is fair, given the price. It is okay for music and videos only.When I use it for calling the other person complains about voice quality. Also, the bluetooth connectivity is poor.After around two months, some times the sound in one or the other ear gets lost.If you are buying a truly-wireless headphones for the first time, you may go for it.

884,Not-durable,"Bought this device in July 2020, when the first lockdown restrictions were lifted and wasn't disappointed. For the price, this device is a god-send and does its job wonderfully. However stressing the device like taking it outdoors for a walk constantly , hampers it so I had to replace the product via warranty 8 months later.Removing 2 stars for the lack of durability; apart from this, it is a perfect device that is from a valuable Indian brand and has superb warranty and sound quality. Just see videos on how to clean TWS earphones and cases clearly as this will help in maintaining the device for a long time. Chinese OEMs are selling TWS for 500/- less that are quite good as well.",3.0 
885,overall is a solid 4.5,"They are very comfortable, worth the cost, they are as solid as any earphones in your ears you can jog, jump, workout comfortable without worrying about them to fall off.The bass quality is very nice.But, prolonged use can cause ear pain, probably cause the whole weight is a bit more than wired ones and is to be bared by the ears; say an hour of using them would be the ""limit"" for me.would i still buy them? hell yeah! they are worth it.",5.0

Unless you plan to keep it in ear all day long, it would be difficult to handle since the  case is a bit too big for placing comfortably in the pocket.The device is attractively designed and he coloured LED add to the charm.

891,Unpaid review,Bought it a few weeks back.Ratings.Sound quality : 3.5/5 considering the price point could have been better. Not for hardcore music enthusiast.Bass : 4/5 it is really good. Booming and thumping.Battery : 5/5 satisfied till now. Will know after a few months.Mic noise : 2.5/5 the worst part. People can barely hear you on the other side if you are in a little noisy place.Connectivity : 4/5 no issues once connected. But sometimes sound doesn't come even if you are connected. You need to factory reset if this occurs.Comfort : 3/5 little on the heavier side. Can't  wear for longer time. I guess its the same in other tws.Honestly It is a good buy. I haven't  tried other products  hence can't  compare.,4.0 
892,Battery backup is not good,"It claims that it gives 5h battery backup after a full charge but i have checked today one headphone shut down in middle after approx 3hrs, so if you want to use it for long time its not possible the battery is not that good. Also, not much comfortable in ear it hurts in the ear bones if you are using it for longer time period.Overall, sound quality is good and bass is also very good.It's been some day only one side of earbud is not connecting properly already did all the troubleshooting given in the mannual not happy with the product..",3.0 
893,Not up to the mark. Not for music/videos. Poor call voice quality.,"1. Sound quality is below average at this price point if compared with products similar price range.2. Call quality is pathetic as the mic produces an errie static noise with voice breaking up at the other end of call.3. Noise cancellation is almost ineffective.4. This is the only earbud which doesn't fit properly.5. Sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality and call quality all are below average.6. Active call/playback time is way less than claimed. Didn't check the battery backup in the charging case.5. I should have returned it but tested the product a little bit late and the return window was closed.6. Should have given 1 star but for brand name and looks I have given 2 stars.7. Now I need to raise the issue with the manufacturer as the product is in warranty.8. For the audiophile this is simple trash. But for regular use you have to read a lot of authentic reviews before buying and please don't get guided by ratings in e-commerce platforms.",2.0 
894,Decent sound quality with nice bass effects!,"Pros - Excellent Backup of Battery charger which obviously is very nice, Decent sound quality with nice bass effectsCons - 1. Acceptable battery life with single usage on full charge2. I noticed that the moment I insert the earphones in my ears I tend to feel heavy headedness and Headaches which is strange being an avid users of earphones like Oneplus Wireless, Is this becoz of the Noise cancellation?3. Fuzzing sound when we turn on the bluetooth with no sound from right earphone.",4.0 
895,Not worth it. Too many issues with quality of sound and Bluetooth connectivity.,I would like to mention the pros and cons after 3 months of usage.Pros:- Battery back up good for the earbuds as well as the charging case. Full charge will give around 3 hours of music.- Quality of plastic okay but one should not buy if priced more than Rs 2000 and if willing to bear with the pathetic customer service in case you face issues even if product is in warranty period..Cons:- After a month of use the left side ear phone sound has decreased significantly which means that the volume of sound is different from right and left side. This cannot be fixed even after factory reset.- After 3 months of usage the right side earphone sound completely stopped and not working anymore.- Worst service center who tell me that since my model is new they don't have spare parts ones to replace or fix the earphones even though the product is under warranty. The answer is sorry even in warranty product cannot be fixed be fixed/replaced as they don's support this model since it is a recent model.- Any emails to official email address provided in Boat website is never acknowledged or replied back.- Customer care does allow you to proceed without a complaint number and local service center are not willing to accept a complaint.- Zero noise cancellation. Putting cotton in your ears will block noise better than boAt airdopes 441 pro. Don't get fooled by noise cancelling used for advertising the product.- The grip in the ears buds does not hold properly and it will fall down frequently if you walk while listening to music. Only good to listen sitting at one place.- You have to switch on phone Bluetooth before opening the case to connect automatically. In case you open the case and later switch on phone Bluetooth it takes multiple manual attempts to connect.- The Bluetooth connectivity starts breaking if one goes more than 10-12 feet away from phone.- Some or the other issues keeps popping time and again therefore factory reset is needed every 2-3 days of usage to fix issues.,1.0 
896,Call quality post pairing with laptop for office calls very bad,"Bought this item mainly to pair with my laptop to attend office calls. The product does not perform well here.

While it worked amazing and I have no had any issues with it for the past 3 weeks, now I can only use one earphone and there is no fix to the issue, multiple people are facing the issue with these earphones when I looked online and there is no fix for it, it just happens suddenly and there is nothing you can do about it. I live in the US and bought these in India right before leaving. The mic was also disappointing as many complained they couldn't hear me. I hope there was a fix to the issue.",1.0 
907,Left earbud  stopped working on the third day..,"This is my first time using any Earpods. I've seen the reviews saying it's average quality but still wanted to give it a try.I am giving this review after using it for 5 days-LOOKS- This has a plastic body which is expected in this price range. Overall it looks good, neither cheap nor expensive.SOUND- Bass is very good. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS A BUZZING SOUND IN THE LEFT EARBUD! you can't notice it while listening to something but if the music stops this sound can be pretty irritating. Otherwise sound quality is good.NOISE CANCELLATION- Its noise cancelling ability is average.CALL FEATURE- If you're in your home it can work pretty well but outdoors the other person can't hear you properly because the mic catches the surrounding sounds.CONTROLS- The feather touch works well but if you accidentally touch it the music can stop or the call can disconnect. But you can manage after few days of using it.BATTERY- The left earpod is not getting charged!!!! It is always on battery low!In short, these pair of airdopes is doing well in the given price range (below 2K). I got this for ₹1699 in Sporty Blue colour and I'm satisfied with the product.",2.0 
908,It is falling down,It's not of good quality. As boat products are good so I bought this but really disappointed. There is no audio while in a voice call or laptop meetings.

When I asked it this problem going to occure frequently she was hesitant to reply and suggested for rest everytime I faced this.

All you have to do is disconnect and connect again. You have to do this whenever you face this issue.*My new review* As per their reply to my old review I have sent an email to boAt on 16th-Aug-2020 regarding the same, now it's 7th-sep-2020 and still no response. At the same time, I have checked their social media handles and comments of different users complaining on lack of response from boAt for any warranty/product issue related queries. So compiling all those, I recommend you choose some other brands who offer good service/support and stay free from these headaches. I feel waste of money now.",1.0 
911,Bad product and bad service,"I had excitedly purchased boat Airpods for myself as a birthday gift to find the product perfect for my use.Gradually a screeching sound started in the device and it kept increasing. The product being under warranty, I raised a complaint on January 14th and the product pickup was delayed by almost 2 weeks. Finally when i received a replacement, it was a dirty, used and looked like a discarded piece.(images attached) after which i quickly raised another complaint for the same, to which the same delayed pickup was initiated. Finally when i received my 2nd replacement, it turned out to be full of earwax (image attached). I tried shooting an email for this, but the mailbox seemed full.My last resort was social media, and here I am, speechless about the whole situation.

Those who are mentioning it are either using low end mobile or else they are lying.I watched movies and listen to many songs its sound quality is superb.*For game lovers - buy it without any hesitation as thier is no latency i just feel like i am playing in wired earphone*Connection speed is so fast*look wise so premiumIf you really want to buy these TWS airdopes 441 PRO go for it you will not regret.*BATTERY  BACKUP  is just as said you will easily get around 5 to 6 hours if using volume at around 50 to 60%.",5.0

915,Good product,I have been using this for more than 2 weeks now. I tried using it in a WhatsApp call but it did not work that great I had many disturbance and connectivity issues in that call. For Google duo it worked fine. Base quality is good. For normal calls it is fine within the room but outside might not have a good noise cancellation.,4.0 
916,Don’t buy.Left earbud stopped working within a month.,I have been a boat user from past couple years and have got multiple boat accessories but these airdopes disappointed me a lot. The left earbud stopped working even before a month all the money down the drain. I seriously did not expected this from boat.I  would definitely recommend boat but not this specific product. I wanted to claim the warranty but for that I need to visit some weird place to get it fixed up. This process is so disappointing I expect so much better from boat atleast a way where I do not have to physically go out in this COVID situation and waste my time on getting this fixed up it should be the responsibility on the vendors end rather than the customer. Highly dissatisfied.,1.0 
917,BEAUTIFUL COLOUR N SOUND QUALITY. Brief review below,I would like brief u about my review with detailed explanation context wise. So we start with Pros(advantage) then cons(disadvantages) And lastly conclusion.Also features about buds..like battery life is all given in description by company 👍 I won't type the manual here again.. I shall give opinion according to my own experience.💯Everything is MY personal point of view.PROS:1. Beautiful colour. I purchased yellow colour which is very vibrant n good looking.2. The sound quality is good and bass as usual is very strong 💯 If u r loyal boat customer.3. Instantly pairs up with ur device via bluetooth. I use One Plus nord.4. Has good sensor touch buttons n gestures for controlling features during music.5. Comes with several different shape n size of buds allowing u to customise according to ur ear shape and is very comfortable.6. I use it during immense workout and is good sweat resistant and Nothing happens if sweat comes in contact with buds.7. Full charge within 2 hours. Very compact..fits in pocket easily.CONS:1. They are a little loose for my ear and left one falls off quite easily but i can be resolved by using correct size of buds.2. After a month or so.. when u use the buds suddenly one of the bud stops working like battery drains abruptly or one doesn't work(goes Silent) after removing from case.3. The buds together don't charge properly and most of times one of them is left out..so while putting buds in case make sure u see both green light on buds only then close it for charging.4. The touch sensor is very sensitive sometimes only few hairs touch n song pauses.CONCLUSION:The product seems a little more than reasonable price but that's alright according to the performance given by the buds. Happy with product and suggest to buy on ur own call because the product is MADE IN CHINA.. so buy it accordingly 👍,4.0 
918,An average to good product with an excellent customer service !!!,"The product has a really good sound quality and durability (minimal noise cancellation as ANC products start around 5-6k). When gaming, there can be a lag in mili seconds if your device doesn't have a good ram, but this is the case with even the most expensive wireless headsets.There is one slight problem. Me and many of my friends bought this product and everyone's earbuds(one of them) got malfunctioned in a couple of months, so that may be a slight issue. But warranty claim is really good, they picked up and delivered back all of us new earbuds (both earbuds replaced not refurbished), and since then it has been 7 months and there has been no issue.Tip:- Do not buy Airdopes 441 but instead, buy Airdopes 441 Pro.",4.0 
919,Serious Bugs with good sound quality and bass,"I just got one question for the manufacturer. Do you test the each product before sell it to your customers? This earbuds have problems in connection with phone when you are on call, any normal or whatsapp. It gets disconnected and reconnect again in like 12 secs but the occurrence of this is very frequent like every 3rd minute when you are on call.I have refunded my amount after 1 attempt of replacement. Same does my friend who bought this earbuds on my referal.Though it's a major issue I want to appreciate sound quality is really good so is the noise cancellation. You can't hear anything if you are on speaker mode. You will have to remove one Earbud to listen. Bass quality is also good.I use to admire boAt before this order.",1.0

922,Average Product without Noise cancellation,This product is good for music lovers. But people using in the form of monopod will have terrible time cause of zero noise cancellation.

926,"Product is fine, but service is the worst!","I bought this product a couple months back, and did face a minor issue in connection. Well, I raised a complaint with the boAt team, and guess what, got an instant reply. The same day they picked my product, and told me they'll provide me with a replacement. Well, that was quick, but my replacement product arrived after literally a month and this time, they sent me a used and old product with a different color. The product was full of scratches and shabby looking. I did raise a complaint again, same response and they literally sent me back the same old used product. After that, they stopped replying to my mail and on call, they say they'll get in 48 hours, and they never have. I am utterly disappointed by the customer service they are offering. I even requested for the same product back, which I had initially raised complaint for, which as well is not going to come back. I have paid for a ""NEW"" product and now am using a old, shabby looking and used by someone else product. I regret my purchase. I will not suggest this brand if you are looking for a quality support for any defects and malfunctioning after you buy the product.",1.0

Does not seem to be painful for longer usage.",5.0 
929,Utility product,I liked the noise cancellation and sound quality of the product along with the grip which ensures that they don’t come off the ears. I bought these during an offer and found them worth the value. The touch is sensitive and you need to be careful while attending calls.,5.0 
930,Good budget rated TWS,"A big fan of Boat. Provides premiumness in budget pricing. Good TWS, but the drive makes a screaching noise at very low volumes.

931,Good sound but bad fit,"As far as the sound is concerned, its fabulous, the bass is too good with crystal quality music. I would give a 4/5 on that. When it comes to fit it in the ear, its extremely inconvenient. Doesn't stay in the ear socket and keeps falling off, if you push it in the ear too hard, its gets too uncomfortable. The mic worked for couple of days and then it became garbled when spoken. Have ordered a replacement for it now as there was no option of return.",3.0

933,"Good product only for music, not for voice calls","If you are planning to use it only to listen songs or YouTube etc, then go for it but if you are planning to use it for voice calls, then give a second thought as the mic is really bad.

934,I loved this Product.,This product built quality & performance is too Good. Sound & Bass quality is awesome but noise cancellation is not good.

935,Bass Lover's Paradise,"I've been using boAt Bassheads for past 2 years and quite satisfied with it, so I naturally I've to go with boAt TWS airdopes. I bought them during prime day sale for ₹1999. Coming to point, If you are a bass lover, then just buy them, look nowhere else. But if you enjoy solace, and listen to podcasts and voice content, then you can seek some other TWS. I won't recommend buying 441 pro since there's hardly any difference between both, even driver size of 6mm is same. With remaining ₹500, just buy a 10000 mAh power bank which can charge both your phone and charging case. Sometimes there's connectivity problem, which can easily be corrected by factory resetting them.",4.0

Only the left ear bud was working even after multiple factory resets. So returned the item. And ordered a fresh pair.On receiving a fresh pair I noticed the packaging was different. There was a thin plastic wrapping all around the box. Also the tapes on the sides of the box had boat logo. None of this was there on the earlier box.So I suspect that the box was either tampered with, or it was a used piece or it was a fake boat product.The new pair of earbuds paired instantly. A detailed review on the fresh pair will be posted separately.",1.0 
946,Beautiful sounding but completely useless,Sound/bass quality is excellent considering the price.Usability is pathetic. The capacitive  touch on the outer side is very sensitive when it doesn’t need to be; I accidentally hit it and pause my music/book/podcast so many times when I’m just trying to adjust them in my ear.And other times it’s completely unresponsive like when I’m trying to turn them off. I keep holding for 5-10 seconds and nothing happens.These would have been the best earphones in their price category had they simply been given buttons instead of this capacitive touch non-sense.

950,Horrible touch sensors,"Do they at least test the product before marketing them? How can people be this irresponsible? I'm pretty sure no developer/tester or any one from boAt tested this product like a real user. Touch sensor is horrible. It's not designed to handle accidental touches. If they only tested this product with phone calls, they would have found it. Seriously man a whole company is irresponsible. This is a basic thing. I can't even adjust the buds when I'm on a call or listening to something. It disconnects the call suddenly (Because I ADJUSTED THE BUDS!!!). It's not easy to put it on without touching the sensor, they should have fixed that issue. Okay I can resist myself from adjusting it during calls, but if the buds are on the table, I can't even take them without touching the sensor, it connects the call before I'm ready. and the worst thing is, this happens only when I put the first bud, you know what happens if I take the second bud and put it on? It disconnects the call. BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE SENSOR....  Wow.... What a product, what a team and what a management. How did they even approve this product? I'm writing this review after using it for 1 hour. boAt team did not even test it for an hour. Completely unsatisfied. I have no other option but return it.

They not give my accessories back so I am getting charging issue as I struggle to purchase another c type charging cable.But the most worst situation is that still I am not able to use the device which was replace with old used product have the same problem with my original device.The other person not able to receive my voice.Try to register a new complain again but there is no option to raised the complain again. Instead the Boat portal is throwing the local service center which is very far away from my address.Which is not possible to visit in the lockdown situation.Request all the viewer pls Don,t buy boat device as their service is very poor. Buy product from them is waste of money.I know this not always with everyone but as a customer we are one and united, please boycot the Boat product as much as possible. Although this also not cheaper but in order to raise my country level up for the growth of boat as Indian company I support it but Boat Don't think for their indian customer.Also request Amazon not to promote such type of company as in directly they are missguiding us and taking away our hard earned money.I was not in favor of this kind of review but I am forced to write thus because ignoring the issue is not a solution.",1.0

965,"Sound Quality is really good, microphone is also good","Quality of this earphones is good, sound quality and controls are good but one thing is you may face some difficulty in your ears if you put it in your ears for long time like more than one hour. Also talking on calls is really good no issue with that.",5.0 
966,Value for money,Amazing ear dopes. Sound quality and clarity is amazing. Charging station also works fine and most of all very easy to travel with saves alot of space and is just perfect. For me the ear-dopes fit perfectly and i can use them for long hour. Really happy,5.0 
967,Awesome,Simply too good...I already bought a Boat airdopes 441 Pro during Amazon Prime day and was quite happy with my buy...The next day I ordered a  Boat airdopes 441. I was happily shocked to see it. It was a much more smaller box than the 441 Pro...I wonder how they managed to put 400 mAh into it...Anyway I hope both last me a year or two...I have other Boat products with which I am very happy till date,5.0

969,Good in sound but bad for calls,Great ear dopes .with one draw back ie on calls the mic is not able to capture sound and the listener has to struggle to hear you. Didnt expect this flaw with boat dopes,5.0 
970,Thats why Rare Indian companies can be trusted!,"Bad quality of sound. No whatsapp calls. High echo bouncy sound don't waste money at all. Don't be surprised to see the offer price, its just expensive then its normal online price. Don't keep your eye on offers.Disappointed! Thats why people don't trust indian companies. Very few companies who keeps promise of quality.Bad bad badest!",1.0

972,It's cheap and it works.,"Sound quality is pretty good but I'm not a basshead and so I had to fiddle through my EQ to adjust that migraine-inducing throb that came with the Airdope's overdone bass. Noise cancellation doesn't really deserve a mention. It feels like you've got a pair of rubber tip buds in your ear. That's about it. The mics are too sensitive to the point of being almost unusable for a lot of calls unless you're in a windowless room and nowhere near a spinning fan. The touch sensitive buttons are overly sensitive and the response is extremely delayed to the point of annoyance. I'd tap the button and wait for a good whole second to know whether my music is about to be paused or not. Also, the bluetooth range is a joke once you leave the room without your phone.Fortunately, I didn't expect a lot from 2000 rupee earphones. I just needed a pair of buds that would give me some ambient music when I'm on the move and wouldn't fall out of my ears easily. The Airdopes 441 obtains passing marks for the ambient music once I fixed the EQ. And it obtains 5/5 for a snug fit. No matter what I did, the buds refused to fall out of my ears despite some rigorous and unrealistic conditions.OverallAudio: 2/5Mic: 1/5Connectivity: 2/5Interface: 1/5Fit: 5/5Design 4/5",2.0

Like 75% of the noise is reducsed. As used this headphone outside the recidency.6. Fitting of the headphone is amaing is use while cycling too. Also dont have fear of loosing them. As its stuck so well in the ears.Negative: -1. After using this headphone more than 30 min, ears start painning badly due to the rubber grips.This review is given after 2 month of use. It your have big ears then go for it as the battery life is amaing.",4.0 
979,Best budget TWS,"The sound quality of these TWS is really impressive and bass is just perfect.For connectivity there is IWP (Instant wake and pair technology) in it, which connects the TWS to your Mobile very quickly.And it also has Fast pair technology (by google) too.The CTC (Capacitive touch control) works properly, there is not much delay in response.I think if you want to buy a TWS in budget segment, then this is the best TWS for you.The only con that I found in these TWS is that you can not control the volume of the bluetooth device by the touch control, you have to reach your smartphone and then you can control it from volume button of your phone.This is a 5 star product in my opinion. Go for it👍🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5.0

Touch controls are great too, very responsive.7. Battery backup is pretty decent.8.

Look wise very good2. Comfort adjustments3. Touch is very good4. battery life is goodCons1. 3pins are given but in case only 2 are available.2. Sometimes issue with touch it accidentally touches a lot.3. Shows 5 hrs but only gives 3.5 hrs music time,3.0 
985,Sound and Design,"I just love this airdopes 441, you get a kind of  noise cancellation without any noise cancellation feature you just have to select the perfet earbud tip size for yourself and its a game of vaccum. At almost 50 to 60% volume they sound great u can increase it according to you… some might face a problem while using it for the first time those who just changed to wireless buds from wired earphone as i said u just have to choose proper size of earbud tip and that ear wings/flag. As mentioned by some YouTube review while whatsapp calling or any internet calling you can hear the person you are talking to but your voice slightly reaches him/her in low volume, on normal call it sounds normal as you are talking on your mobile it self after all its wireless. The design is great it fits properly after using proper siz budtip , i loved those rgb lights , the touch response is a very little bit slow almost half sec delay u can feel when u pause or play a song. Other than that this are very good tws earbuds. If you want great sound quality , great Bass quality you can blindly go for this ones .",4.0

990,Not a good fit + Previously opened box with missing accessories,"The box i received was previously opened. The sealed sticker was removed and normal tape was put in place.Accessories like extra eartips were missing.Apart from that, the tap button on the airdopes is actually a bad design.

I have applied for warranty service 2 times and both times I recieved a defective product which makes the same noise and one airdope button was not working🔇🔇🔇.

992,Grear Bass for Gym Heads,"After searching multiple earbuds, I found this one. Even when you put these without music, I hardly can hear anything from the surrounding which is great. The earbuds are great with bass and overall quality and volume. Being a music lover at the gym , I keep the volume at 80% and it's amazing. The best earbuds within this budget. If you're worried about the trebles because of the bass, i felt the trebles are great. 😍",5.0 
993,Quality is sturdy and sound is crisp. Go for this TWS without any second thought.,The looks and feel of the device is very good. CASE is heavy and looks classy. Pairing and connectivity is good and sound is clear and loud for user. Bass and thump is better than most of the TWS in this price range. It automatically conects to your device once you open the top lid of the case. Noise cancellation is Neither good nor bad.I was using it on 75% volume for most of the time and its hold on charge for around 4hrs 45 minutes.

1022,Value for money and great sound,I was a bit skeptical at first but once I purchased it on the Amazon sale..I am in love with it. The sound quality is amazing and once paired it connects directly as soon as the bluetooth is switched on. Definitely worth it at 1799.,5.0 
1023,Only buy it if you are only inclined to listening bass,"Bought it 2 days, returned it very next day. Absolutely disappointing. I had a very high expectations but it all come down when I tried it for 2 3 hours and it was a very sorry experience.I was inclined to buy tws but this absolutely rubbish in sound quality, hence went for enco m31 from oppo, and I am in love with it.Coming to 441,Pros:1. Case feels great in hand and durable.2. Airdopes also seems pretty well structured and feels good while handling. Touch capacitive is Plus but can be bothersome while calling as it hung up many times while adjusting it in my ear.3.USB CCons:1. STRONG BASS HEAD only go for it. There is very much predominance of bass that every other vocals and trebles is subdued. Using equaliser didn't work and made listening exp pretty bad.2. Call quality is very average as the other party continously complained of the noise and distorted voice. Don't buy it if you have to attend calls.3. Used it for 3 hours and it was painful. Somehow rubber grip didn't fit well in my ear and can be bothersome in long usage. Not everyone may be interfered though.Main reason for returning was BASS, I like bass but here it's not caliberated properly and it really started to bother you when you listen to it for more than 30 mins. Even less subtle songs had thumping effect. If you have such taste, who likes Full thumping in your ears, go for it. For me, on long usage it turned out to be painful.",2.0

Advised me to get it checked at the Boat Service Centre in this pandemic situation.Sometimes left side airdrop light goes off but working. Sometimes light blinks or only red light blinks but no sound from the airdrop. Very unusual behavior of the product.I think 10 days return window is not a great idea. Like in my case I called Customercare exactly on 11th day with few hours passed should be considered +- a day should be ok. Its like borderline. You have your own guidelines and procedures. May next 10 days or 20 days doorstep service/support by company should be their.,1.0 
1027,Not so better than rockerz 255 with compared to any of the “(boat tws)”,"i really wonder have any of these people who are giving a hype like thumping bass,sound quality and all have atleast tried a really good earphones first of all let me get straight my experience is,never expect a good sound quality from “TWS” honestly i have tried many all the tws by boat 441 171 281 etc; i could only say one thing none of these give better feel than boat rockerz 255 yes it is...!! i dont know why mightbe lack of a wire or anything if u are really buying these for enjoying music go for bluetooth wired like rockerz 255,boult probass,curve or anything you would like,if any of you know anything better than 441 which gives a good and loud sound suggest me..",3.0

1029,Boat Airdopes 441- a must buy for everyone,"Whatever I buy from online shopping, I always drop the true comments. So, let me share with you the reviews about Boat airdopes 441. The airdopes come with a very nice packaging and the box is also sealed with boat sticker. As soon as you open the box, the airdopes give a very shiny blink light. Talking about the sound quality, th noise cancellation is quite imperessive. There is no volume control in the airdopes and thats is not even required, use your phone instead to ajdust the volume. The upper and lower notes are clearly audible. Now, my favorite part, the bass- I am totally satisfied with the bass quality as it is quite high and smooth. This is a must huy for everyone in this proce range.",4.0 
1030,It stopped working,"I purchased the product on 28-12-2021, and the left earbud stopped working today 25-3-2022, its not working at all, its constantly blinking (green and blue) no matter how much i charge it.. no use.. the moment i take it out of the case its not showing the blue light and if i press it, its showing very less red light and the other one (working one) is showing more..I tried calling the number they provided with the warranty card but no use, this is utterly disappointing and unacceptable, i paid 2k and it didnt even last a year.",1.0

1032,Fabulous!,"Go for it without any doubt! If you're a music lover you'd love it,especially the bass lovers. The mic works well too in indoor condition.I was confused at first by looking at the 6mm driver, but just don't go by the numbers, it's much more better than most of the 10mm drivers!The battery life is good too, I've used it continuously for 3hrs at around 70/80%volume, the charge was still 40%, which means it'll last between 4-5hrs.Overall it's a very good product at this price range.",5.0 
1033,Best in this budget,"Sound quality- awesome, best at 60-70% volume. But don’t mind increasing more for more bass, but shouldn’t do it for long duration.Noise cancellation- satisfactory, tried in outdoor traffic, doesn’t completely shut off the background noise but does it satisfactorily.Calling: no problem, comfortable, no lagging.Gaming: 1/2 second lag, didn matter for me much as i m not that into games. But if you are then consider it.Grip: Perfect, didn fall even after vigorous exercise or jumping or turning sideways while  in bed.",4.0

1035,Call Quality extremely bad,"Expected boat - an Indian product to be good. However, call audibility especially to recipient is very bad. Tried atleast 6 friends.

I returned it y'day and purchased Oneplus Buds Z. My friend was using it. I tried it. Voice calling was extremely good. boAt, we want you to improve as we want Indian designed products to flourish.

1037,Do not Buy. Spend a little more and get a good brand,"It has just been 6 months and the left one of the pair has stopped working and doesn't even get charged. Maybe these pairs are at such great discount for the same reason. There's no return or warranty on these.More so I didn't even enjoy listening to songs with these on. There wasn't an option to return and hence had to stick to it.I also went through the other reviews wherein people have expressed the same concerns.

1042,Doesn't fit properly at all.,"The buds don't fit in the ear properly and you need to constantly keep checking it to make sure it doesn't fall off. If you sit still, then the sound and bass quality is very good but if you move even slightly you'll feel the difference. If you're to bend down with the buds in your ear, you'll actually feel it slipping off and falling. The fitting issue is so great that I have to purchase another pair of headphones/earphones but it definitely won't be any product from this company. I regret not listening to my friend who advised me against buying this product or any product from this company in general.",1.0

1046,Over Hyped Budds - Make your ear VACCUM,"After seeing lots of videos on YouTube and reviews - We ordered this product. But to be honest, we didn't like it much. Once you put it in your ears, it creates a vacuum and start hurting your ears within 15-20 minutes. Sound quality is just average. The only plus point is the battery backup. Also the left side ear bud doesn't fit properly inside the case and sometimes don't get charged even after having a magnetic hold. We use it in GYM and it doesn't fall from your ear. But if your trainer/friend speaks to you, you have to take it off from your ear to listen.",2.0

( so much that it distorts the whole music experiance)-Poor vocal clarity! ( due to high bass, the vocals arent even clear so its very disturbing for a music lover)-touch area ( the touch area is very big and hence each time you try to wear it or remove you're gonna either pause or play the music and thats very annoying)So i exchanged the product and bought boult audio airbass propods and i must say it is the one i was looking up for!✌️",2.0

Even the Airdopes were not getting auto disconnected after putting them in case.I called for replacement & fortunately the seller sent me the replacement much earlier.The sound & bass quality of this 441 Airdope is better with its 6 MM driver than Realme Q 10 MM driver eardopes.In my opinion, its better to listen this TWS around 60-70% volume to avoid cracking sound. Also, my replaced Airdopes are giving better battery backup now. It runs around 4-5 hours.I hope you my review will be helpful for new buyers.",3.0

Lost the trust and my money.Hi All,  The Boat company have send a replacement 2 weeks for the defeticve item and I'm satisfied with their response although a little delay but that's understandable due to covid-19 pandemic.

I have accidentally dropped the airdopes from my hands and no damage is seen as the build quality is also very good. If you have a little extra cash then go for the pro version of this product as the case will also work as a mini powerbank.Noise cancellation when talking is okay okay. When I talked with the airdopes on, the other person would hear noise and I have to talk louder in order for them to listen properly.Overall product is very good and the ear pieces won't come out of your ears as they fit very nicely.",5.0 
1056,Overall this true wireless earphones are great,The earphones have a great sound quality and are very comfortable .

The packaging and designing is good.When you connect your left earpiece, constant noise comes and it is very irritating.If you wear this earpods for more than an hour, you ears might start paining.If you Play some mobile fames connecting these earpods, there is a major lag in the sound and the game..Needs major update or rectification. I may change the product once its available again.",2.0 
1094,Good piece of earphone so far after a week's use,"Pretty decent earphone by BoAt in a range of bright colours.But do not fall prey for Amazon's Lightning Deal like me. I bought the product in Lightning Deal for Rs1999, when the actual price was showing as Rs2499.But a couple of days after Lightning Deal was over, the actual price was reduced to Rs1799. So I have basically paid Rs200 extra, thinking that I have made a profit.",4.0 
1095,Overall a good product,"Only 2 drawbacks are - my ear hurts after some time because of the pad (the fan shaped rubber to cling to the ear securely), and if mistakenly the airdopes are touched, the song pauses or call ends (as it is touch controlled).Otherwise it is very good product. I did not check the mobile charging feature yet.",5.0 
1096,Waste of money,Mic stopped working. I can play music but cant received and call using earbuds. Have reset to factory setting multiple time but it is not working.Customer service is pathetic.

1102,Good buy if your requirement is only for Music,"This is my first set of wireless earphones. My experience for this is really good, the sound quality is really good with good bass too. These are extremely steady and fits my ears perfectly. Battery life is also good. My requirement for this apart from music is also for calling, and that's where it doesnt get a perfect score. For calling purpose, there is slight disturbance and also, people on other side often hear background noise at my end.All an all a perfect buy if your requirement is for music at this price point.",4.0

Pathetic sound quality coupled with crazy microphone which catches loads of background noice. And it also has very popr design, touch capacitive buttons are so sensitive that it impossible to remove earphone without activating the touch, even if you have to adjust the earpieces you need to touch the button which end up the call pr stops the music.

1108,Good Battery backup.,Using it for a month now withIpone and oneplus.Good product ti have in this price range.Both ear buds work good separately as well.Sound quality is great and so is bass.Noise cancelation is not that good.Good battery backup.It almost go for more than 8 hrs nonstop when fully charged .Good product.,4.0 
1109,Worth the money,"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of extensive usage.Design: 4/5. It's small and eartips out of the box are comfortable. It fits perfectly in my ears. The big eartips had better passive noise cancellation. Although the small hooks provided really caused pain in my ears. Eventhough it's made of rubber, it didn't adjust properly or simply was not made for my ear. But it's removable so I bid goodbye to that ear hooks and now no pain at all.Sound quality: 4/5. It's fairly great. Bass is decent, treble and highs and lows arr balanced. No noticeable distortion at high volume too. But if you are a gamer and you need to hear footsteps to play, you will be disappointed with any other TWS at this price range, let alone this one. Because it has a significant amount of latency. So not recommended for gaming.Battery: 4/5. I listen my songs and watch videos all at 100% volume at all times. So at a stretch the earphones lasted me around 4 hours straight. And with the box, considering I use the earphones for approximately 4 to 5 hours a day, the charge in the case lasted me for an entire week until I had to recharge it again. It has almost become a routine that I have to charge it in every Mondays.Misc: 3.5/5. Considering sweat proof feature, it's fairly decent. It withstood my daily workouts and cardio. And the CTC is extremely sensitive. It responds to even minute accidental touches. And when I lie down, the accidental touch by the pillow causes it to pause my song. Although over a week of usage, I got used to it and so would you.And the connectivity is very good. You switch the Bluetooth on on your phone, and then open the box and it will get connected ( for the very 1st time of usage, you need to connect it manually) automatically. And the range is also decent. I leave my phone charging at one room and I wander around my house still it doesn't get disconnected.And there's one issue with the earphones. There is some kind of static noise in few apps. For me it happened while playing COC. It's low in volume but still noticeable, and at times annoying but I am used to it now. This issue and the fact that I had to remove the rubber earhooks to be comfortable are the only noticeable cons to this TWS to me.Conclusion: Overall a very good product. It's my first body product and tbh I am not disappointed. It's an all-rounder. Good sound quality, decent battery, good design. I don't know about other TWS at this range but according to me, for 2k it's pretty much worth the money.",4.0

1114,Extremely bassy,"I bought this product hoping to get mediocre sound with good build, build part was as expected bluetooth pairing and overall usage experience was also pretty good. But the sound on these earphones is very unbalanced a LOT of thumpy bass to the point where it suppresses every other sound in a song , the bass tires your ear , i adjusted it with equaliser but then it reduced the sound quality overall.Only buy this if you are literally a bass head(a thumpy one not the deep bass kind) because it thumps your skull rendering you buzzed out.",3.0

It comes with IPX7 technology.4. The voice experience is very good in  songs.5. But at last to be very honest there is a  problem in connectivity. Means  sometime the connection get lost by its  own and we have to restart the  Bluetooth.6. And secondly the battery drains very fast  after 80%.7. I also want to mention that the design of  eardopes is also not that comfortable.  My ears start paining after usage of 3  and a half hours.8. There is a huge latency while playing  video on you tube or some other videos  also.  I want you to consider these points.  I am telling these things by my own  experience.",3.0

1159,Superb earphones for the price,"It's quick, good and smooth. Sound quality is good, you get nice bass too. Touch control is just so cool. Battery life yet to be checked. But overall good for price range. Cannot expect noise cancellation in this price range. So we can live with that.",5.0

1161,Worst model in the production line of Boat,"The model airdopes 441 is totally trash. When I got the product, it was a total nightmare. The product was not charging, battery backup of the ear buds was less than an hour. So I got a replacement for this and I must say the product was made in a hurry. The replacement eardopes were producing a static noise and the charging case’s backup was approximately 7 hours, which was far less than the mentioned 25 hrs. I’m saddened to say, as I’m a regular customer of Amazon but never expected this kind of service till now.",1.0 
1162,Pros Cons,"Great sound.Great fit bit uncomfortable after an hour or two but tolrable.Great build.Good case with magnet so no accidental fall.Both eqrfones have there own touch control and moc, so one can use just one earfone at a time for call or music.Just one issue or con i.e. Battery backup is quite less only 3 hours per full charging.",4.0 
1163,Not worth it,These earbuds have given me trouble since day 1. Typically one earbud doesn’t work. I have tried factory reset as well but it still doesn’t work. Plus getting in touch with the service center is a nightmare. Not worth the headache. I have barely used it because there is some problem or the other. It doesn’t easily connect to the laptop either. Not worth it.,1.0 
1164,Mic is poor,For all the buyers out there please take a good note.This airdopes are pretty good in term of sound quality performance and bassThere is a little bit of latency and I don't recommend it for gaming.But one thing  that so horrible for it is the mic. Well at first I thought I got a defective product but soon realised most people are facing the same issue. But many don't know it yet as most boat user love it for its sound quality and that is something you can love. But I can tell you one thing that it is not for calls period.,3.0 
1165,Dont buy it at all,"One side airdope stopped working within 15 days, then later these airdopes were not able to detect in Bluetooth section if phone..when i raised ticket for replacement then it took more than 1 month to get replacement,And the worst part it, they sent me other model airdopes 311v2 which was the older model and cheaper than airdopes 441.The customer support is pathetic, it is practically impossible to connect with them on call , i tried more than 50 times but unable to have words with thr customer support.I suggest dont buy it at all..this is not a standard process driven company.",1.0 
1166,Good,"Nice tws at this price.ProsGood battery backup,Nice audio output,Negligible lag in audio during videos and music,Nice fit to ears and nice design.ConsNot fit for gaming,since there is no low latency you will be noticing lag during gaming,I have faced lag in audio while playing pubg.so not recommended for gaming.Average noise cancellation,Very few times you may face some connectivity issues, but not a major problem it can be simply solved by factory reset.Finally it's good at this price but you can look at boulton tws at same price with low latency.",4.0 
1167,Poor case battery and poor microphone for calling,The main reason someone will buy this is the battery life promised. But let me tell uh battery life is not long as described. Uh will get a max 10-15 time charge in the case after that case will discharge. I already claimed warrenty and got a replacement order from boat but the charging issue was same. Rest the sound and bass is very good. But microphone is poor for calling as I am experiencing this.,3.0

1170,Poor quality. Product malfunctioned twice in 10 months.,"The sound quality and bass quality of the product is average. The issue is with the product built/quality. The product started malfunctioning (the left ear bud wasn’t charging) after two months of purchase. Got it replaced. Now on the 13th month of purchase, the entire case is not charging. The service centres are also too far and few. Boat had started with door to door pickup and drop service. They have pulled it back.Seriously disappointed with the service and product built.",1.0 
1171,Battery!,"I ordered them in the Amazon sale and got them for a very good price, sound is good, so is the bass. I mean for the prices it could have been the best buy in this segment but the battery for me was very very bad. It drained out from 100 to 50% in just 30 minutes of music usage on 70% volume. Not acceptable when the manufacturer claims 5 hours of backup. Also the left ear bud started heating up during the usage. Build quality and everything else is fine but the major selling point for this product is battery backup and if the buds cannot even have 3 hours of battery life on a single charge then no point in having a charging case providing 150 hours of backup.I returned them and got the refund pretty quickly, not worth the time and effort.",1.0

The device is meant to be worn for hours apon end, but it isn't comfortable to wear it and starts to hurt your ears.",3.0 
1236,First Copy received instead of original product.,"I ordered boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds on 09-Dec-2020. Got my order on 11-Dec-2020. 5 stars for delivery and packaging.I'm writing the review of 2 different products, first one is the original and second is the copy of product which I got in a replacement.I replaced my product coz I'm getting a static noise in left ear bud and got my replacement today means 13-Dec-2020. And when I opened the package (Packaging was best for both the deliveries) I suspect that box is lightweight as compare to previous box and the company's original packaging is not there.Then I opened the box, inside the box following items are there (Replacement product which I received today, first product contains all the accessories which is mentioned in product description) :1. Charging Case (micro-USB supported)2. Earbuds3. Warranty Card4. User Manual5. Charging cable (micro-USB)NO EXTRA EARGRIPS AS MENTIONED IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.Second thing was the earbuds are not original as you can see in image belowAlso the charger is micro USB instead of type-C charger.Also the lablel of PRC and related information was not there at below the charging case (Image provided)And I ordered a Spirit Lime color, the charging case is of spirit lime but inside the case it's yellow and the earbuds are also yellow.Completely disappointed from Amazon services this time...never expected this.I'm guessing the product I received is also a replacement product coz of the tape marks which is present on the box that completely means Amazon are not checking whether the customer is returning the original product with all it's accessories or notA BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE.",1.0

But 😂😂 i guess its cheaper in the range of true wireless or the stuff used in making it is cheap, anyways, its got a disturbance like how old tvs sounded on mute. It isn't even audible with all that heavy base and all but when you're in mood of listening to quite piano songs or just let it be on mute. Damn, its really annoying.",3.0 
1241,Good product but uneasiness in the ear makes it bad,Sound feels good but 2 drawbacks 1. if u r using u can't hear a thing of ur surroundings so using them on the road while driving is a misadventure.  2.

But it's bass boosted that you will have to go to your eq available on your music player and make the eq flat and even cut the bass further. Otherwise the connectivity is great. Battery backup so far is good.The hardest part is these dopes are not very comfortable for the ears, the rubber pads that lock to ears will cause pain just after 1-2 mins of use. Folks at Boat have done a decent job otherwise, but these rubber supports are causing pain to the ears. Here In my case. Also the noise cancellation is not the best.",3.0

I truly regret buying this headset. Please think twice before buying this headset.,1.0 
1246,"Don't buy this product, better look for any other brand but Boat",Felt cheated by Boat and Amazon.The main problem is hardware quality. Within 2 months of purchasing touch controls stopped working. I asked for replacement and they took 20 days for it. On top of that replacement is more faultier than original one. Left earpeice was giving hiss sound and right earpiece was disconnecting very frequently. Once again I asked for replacement but this time I visited service center and they have replaced it instantly.I think Boat is giving refurbished products to their customers.,1.0

And when looking all over then its best. its very good in noice cacellatiion etc... and for me it fits in ear very comfortably only when removed that extra thing over that. And also give a large hour play back and bass is also veryy good. Thank you 'BOAT' For This Amazing Product,5.0 
1249,Dope!!!,The overall sound quality is amazing. Treble is clear even at higher volumes. Bass is deep. Connectivity is good. Latency is near about zero.

Big thumbs up to boat for producing this wonderful gadget.,5.0 
1250,Good,The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is good for the person using it but the person on the other side of the call can hear the surrounding sounds more.

Boat replaced and provide me old used product. Now this replaced product is also not working properly, call disconnects in between ongoing call.

Sound quality is decent but if you compare it with the products in this process range it's good. Look wise  airdopes are very attractive and specially the light adds up to it.

1270,Worth the money,"Audio and call quality is decent. But daym. Idk if it's just the buds but the noise cancellation beat the Kolkata metro sound and local bus, so I'm happy.

1271,Stopped working after 3months,Sound and Bass quality is just average. Noise cancellation is very poor. I thought of going for an Indian brand and was uttermost disappointed with this airdopes 441. Main problem with these ear buds are once it gets connected it will only last for 5-10 minutes after that you cannot hear the voice clearly. Would have given 0 star rating if it is possible on the Amazon platform,1.0

It looks great but offers poor noice cancellation so will not recommended at this price.,3.0 
1280,In just one day right earbud stopped working,"I received  the airdopes on 21 Feb and followed all the instructions given with the airdopes to be done before using it , still after like within 2 hours of using right ear bud stopped working , which is a very bad experience for a customer who buys the product by investing money .

It was a very bad experience , I suggest before buying this product do ask people who have used this product or are using this product",1.0 
1281,Better avoid these budget earphones,"There is hardly any bass, simple voice calls are so sharp and almost pricks the eardrums. The touch system is over-engineered. Its so confusing to remember to hold 2seconds to do something, 3 seconds to do something, 5 seconds for something else. The flashing lights are very confusing and inconsistent. No wonder there are 50 models listed in Airdopes, you cant get quality with that focus on scale.",2.0 
1282,Average,First of all the looks are awesome.10/10 for looks.Sound and bass is also good 9/10.But in case of comfort it's not that great.It starts paining in the ear after wearing it for more than 30-40 mins.So 6/10 for comfort.And battery service is the usp for this product once fully charged the case you don't have to worry for atleast a week.And another con of this product is that it does'nt connect correctly sometimes to the pc.There is some problem with the pc connection.Overall 7.5/10.,3.0

1312,"Totally untrustable brand .. this product shows major issues like connectivity ,sound problem.",At first I trust on boat company seeing less review .I bought boat airdopes 441TWS it showed me connectivity problems and  sound quality also not so good.I thought it's a manufacturer problem  then I returned and ordered same product trusting on boat company but it is clear that  it is totally an untrustable product .On second order it showed major problems from starting which is totally unusable.. I am totally unsatisfied with this brand.... Don't buy this product . It's only wastage of money nd time.,1.0 
1313,READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU PURCHASE,Okay to start with do not go as per the review.1.It doesn’t fit correctly and if you try to wear it you will have a ear pain.2. The quality of sound is not great also MIC doesn’t function properly.3.The colour I went for Is flashy and it’s not subtle.4. MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS ITEAM IS NOT RETURNABLE!!!!!! You only have an option to replace with the same pair of AirDopes (lol)So not worth a buy..,1.0 
1314,2 stars because it doesn't work properly when attending calls,"In my one monthof use ,It's a nice and convenient piece of bluetooth headset only for listening music-not to attend calls.When attending calls it gets disconnected frequently and reconnects.That's y I give 2 stars",2.0 
1315,Below my expectations!!,Not value for money... sound quality is good. But he battery backup is really really poor.. after 1 or 2 hour battery totally down.. need to charge again.... it took time to charge... coz of the capacitive touch... it is over senstive... by mistaken if ur get touched to the airpods while adjusting then the call immediately disconnected... according to me not that much helpful what I thought..,2.0 
1316,Could be more better,"After using it for few.months I am writing this review and they have started having issues some or the other..infact when I bought they had high voice quality and sound was clear, bass was perfect.. apparently now it's not the case volume has reduced a bit,. Bass not that strong anymore, and clarity of sound is less..infact it gets off on it's own.",4.0 
1317,Only sound does not matter,I bought it and for a day i was happy with it regarding its sound quality. SUPERB BASS. But other things do matter. I had to replace as there was an indistinct buzzing sound from one side all the time you use it whether on or standby . Quiet irritating but the second one was worse. the buzzing sound was louder and the buds would often lose their sync. Either one or both would also disconnect frequently and buds would not charge sometimes when you place them in case. you have to look to it adjust somewhere then it would charge.,2.0 
1318,Very good product,"Its a very good product if you looking for a good quality earbuds i suggest you these are the best earbuds i am using them since 14 nov,2020 and they working as good as they were before and also very good bluetooth connectivity you just need to pair your earbuds only at once in the begining otherwise when you open your earbuds charging box they'll connect automatically you don't need to connect again and agian.

Sound quality is better than good, but not excellent. The most important thing I did not check was noise cancelling and that causes issues as I take calls, it's very hard for caller to hear our voice clearly but if background noise is reduced then it's excellent.

1324,Unworthy,Boat was the most trustworthy and reliable product for me till I brought this Boat airdopes 441I bought it during prime day sal.Many of the airdopes 441 has the same issue which were sold during that period :Left earbuds will make some sort of noise after some time of usage which makes your ears pain and using it for an hour or more you feel annoyed.And there is no noise cancellation which makes this not at all viable for  Calls.I got replacement still found the same sort of problemBut Pros being sound quality a decent bass at this price as always promised by Boat,1.0

Bad Product and Customer Service.",2.0 
1326,Good,"Used it for 1 year on an average of 5-6 hours per day. Passive noice cancellation, bass is good. The sound was balanced even in 100% volume for some 3-4 months after purchase. But now the treble has slightly increased. And I love the battery backup. I usually charge the case once in a month. Not that good for gaming (latency). But great for music lovers. Overall this is a good tws, and it is worth that price.",4.0 
1327,"Worst Service, Low quality and no Warranty","I'm giving 1 star for the after sales service and the product quality. I bought the product on 13th June and within 2 months the left earpod is not getting charged in the charging case. I have bought 1 Bluetooth headset, 1 Bluetooth Speaker, 1 Bluetooth Earpod and 1 wired earphone from Boat and the only thing still working is the Bluetooth speaker maybe because I paid a hefty amount on that and as instructed in the Boat site to avail warranty I raised the ticket or request and uploaded the invoice downloaded from the Amazon site.  Later I received a mail stating that the invoice is not valid or clear. I have repeatedly sent the mail attaching the downloaded invoice copy from amazon site and still they haven't given a revert. They are not going to replace your product if it's faulty and they are the biggest thieves I have ever seen. I made a great mistake by purchasing boat products and I regret that I spend more than 10k on this low quality products.",1.0

1329,"Too heavy, not conformable",These eardopes are Good in sound quality. But they are too heavy and not comfortable. If you watching your phone while sitting or if you lie down on your bed then they will fall down eventually. They are too heavy for my ears. I tried changing the ear cups several time but not much improvement. Returned them.Sound and call quality is good. No problem in connectivity. Buy it only if you okay with their weight. Try them maybe you will get accustomed them in few days or weeks,2.0 
1330,Booming Bass But Average Battery Life,"I received it today i.e 28th July 2020 and with the 6 hours I used it out of the box, the battery dropped from 67% to 11%.I'm going to update this review after a full power cycle of the charge in the headphones.For it being the first day here's my feedback -Volume 3/5 - Could be better, a 5-6% lower volume than the JBL 205BT that I also haveAudio Spectrum 3/5 - The sound image is Bass heavy, there were instances where the bass overpowered and masked all other frequencies. Thumbs down for music consumption. It still is great for Movies, Shows and Games.Features 4/5 - The touch controls are sensitive and even a scrape of any part of your body might pause or change the track. Although I really wish there were volume controls for this. Volume needs to be adjusted manually from the paired device.Build 4/5 - Good build quality and stable fit in the ears. The point deducted is for the charging box lid which is just loose and cheap feeling when open.Overall for the first day of use I faced no pairing issues with the variety of devices I connected to and I'm waiting to review it further 3 months down the line.",3.0 
1331,Static noise on right earbud,"There were other reviews explaining the same issue of hearing a static noise in addition to music from one of the buds. One reviewer pointed out that even his exchanged product had same issue. I will update review if my exchanged product is better or worse.EDIT: The new exchanged product also had a similar issue with the noise. But it was not as prominent as the previous one. So, I guess this brand and model has the issue. So please make an informed decision before buying.[Other than the noise, everything else seems fine and good.]",2.0

I am writing this review on 20th June.Original review:I love the audio quality and bass quality of these earphones. The only thing that is not up to the mark is microphone. You have to speak louder on calls and sometimes the other person hears surrounding noises more than your voice.

1359,Very good product from BoAt. Must buy.,I will recommend this product. The sound quality is superb. Mainly the base. Those who are base lover this eardopes would be best for them.

I guess quite good in this range.",4.0 
1361,VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!!,The company is INDIAN and the packaging was very good. It arrived in a good condition and the sound quality was also good. The range of the Bluetooth connectivity is awesome and it is overall a great product. You can use them in a mono mode too and it has a one year warranty too. The case battery is very long lasting for 5-7 days. They have the ear rubbers extra also according to your size. I would totally recommend it.,5.0

1363,For Bassheads,"First thing that strikes about this product is the bass, its a lot. Though not considered desirable by audiophiles, as it subdues the nuances of mids and highs. But that does not disregard the sound it has to offer - Bass heavy but still pretty decent for the price point.Also the bass and noise cancellation depends on how snugly one fits it in the ear. Advisable not to fit too snug in the ear as it can lead to discomfort in the ear and also too high a bass.Though it fits fairly well without putting it too much inside, and wont fall off, even on a jog.Bought it for my cardio workouts, it serves the purpose - Never falls off and sounds decent.Pretty satisfied with the product.",4.0

The sound quality also is very poor, even similar copied items being sold by the roadside vendors in rs.50/100 are far better. But the battery is good.

1375,Worthless.,I bought them on the day of their launch and they lasted me less than six months. This includes a replacement that took Boat 5 weeks to carry out.

Not reason enough to spend 2-grand on a device.,1.0

1444,Worth the money,"I just got this package today. First of all the delivery facility was really good. Even in this lockdown I received my package in 6 days outside the city. I've tested for sound, base quality. Both are great. Atleast at this range it is really awesome. The LEDs are so cool. With flashing green and blue lights. The touch control is quiet efficient and has a red LED for that. In pictures the case might seem big but it's so small and can fit in your pocket. I was worried at first about the calling facility. I've only tried that once. It was quiet good actually. There was no complaint for the person on the other side. It might not be as good outside. It has a good enough range to keep your phone at one place in a room. I've looked up about IPx7. It says this device will be okay being submerged under 3 feet or 1 m of water for 30 mins. *Don't try to test this. This is only to assure you that it can handle sudden rains and water splashes or sudden falling in water. So I think it's pretty good for the price we're paying. Again there is the case of noise cancellation. I'd say this one is pretty good in its work. I've been using boat products for 3 years now.

1465,Think before buying.,Quality & sound wise very good. But chances of falling down while walking or in the journey is a draw back.Neckband is safe. Whenever you want you can put in ear and after use you can hang on you with neckband. But where as you can do like this with airdopes. You must carry charging case,4.0 
1466,Everything is great apart from static sound from left earbud,"There's a static sound in left earbud which starts randomly and is very irritating while listening to music at low volumes, left earbuds have a slightly lower volume level as compared to right ones.Apart from this touch control is great, fit is the best I have ever got, I never seem to got it loose so far, battery life is good enough also it charges fast with the carry case and works well for me.Boat, please work on the design flaw of the static sound and replace for everyone those who got it, it's really irritating, expecting Boat to serve in the best way possible",3.0 
1467,Worst Sound. Full of Glich noise. Worst Mike.,"Worst Bass Quality. There is frequent Glitch which can be heard. The Mike is worth 1Rs headphone.

1469,"After 15 days, either of the earbud stops working for a minute or so abruptly",Its very disappointing n irritating how this product works on n off. Sound quality n other things are good but either of earbud stops working for minute or so n starts working again. Sometimes I even have to reset it to make it work. N the frequency of this happening is recurring that one can not even enjoy single song of 3 mins completely with both earbuds working properly. Its almost impossible. So just don't buy it.

Even if your finger touch accidentally while scratching your ear. That's it. It stops the play. If you accidentally touch it for more than 2 seconds it switches off the one earpod. Adding fuel to it! If you are on call, Never even scratch your ear. then rest is history. It cut the call. You have to call them back. :(When it comes to quality and music. It's awesome.

1473,Hissing noise in left ear bud,The Air quality is balanced.  The playback time and case backup together is pretty good. Seems like a decent purchase for The sale price.NOTE: body not recommended to be used as a powerbank unless essential.  Which was one of the USP for buy this device so a little bummer.The flip cover of the case feels a little fragile.NOTE : Within two Days I started hearing this hissing noise from the left ear bud.  Its pretty madding.,1.0 
1474,Brought in sale for 2499rs. Go for 441 pro instead of 441,Great purchase. Case is handy n sturdy. Buds fitting is good. Buds are not at all bulky.

I also got it replaced with same device  but the issue still persists. Tried with other laptops too. :(",1.0 
1491,Budget TWS under 3k.,"Budget TWS. Sound quality is clear and bass is above average. The CTC has a lag of 1 second but that's because touch controls mainly require to process it for the counts of touch. Comfortable 100%. Fits just right and you won't feel it after 5 mins. Proper fit makes it hard to fall of the ear even while exercising.  Connectivity is about 10m, from one room to other. After that it pauses and resumes automatically. Build quality is good. 'IWP' feature saves time as pods are ready to use out of the box anytime.Overall 8/10.",4.0

1493,Not good.. my personal view is its just waste of money.,Doesnt sit properly in ears.. slips off most of the times. The other person cant hear properly even after being so loud on calls. Its like i had to scream to make them hear me out clear. Noise cancellation is zero. The other person in call can hear my surroundings but not my voice. I felt its just waste of money. As its just lying at home doing nothing. I was so interested to buy n bought it. But not even a week i felt its waste and lost my interest using it.,1.0

1496,Things u must know before buying this airdopes 441,"For Bassheads the is best earbuds this is for those who like boom boom type of music. Because of this boom the mids and vocal are not that clear. And if u like to listen music on high volume then this is not that great pick the volume is not that loud. The loudness is okish. In department of calling, thease earbud perform average. If u are in silent area  the mic is  very well and good. But if u are in little bit of noisy area the mic quality is simply not ok. And of u kind of guy who pick up calls on bike then there is big no from my side. Only in silent area the mic is good, otherwise the mic is below averageVerdict :-  This is only for boom boom type of music listners and who take calls in silent area that's it.",3.0 
1497,Don't buy this product!!,"I thought it would be a nice pair of earphones with good sound quality and battery life but was highly disappointed. I have already replaced these once but both times the product I recieved was faulty. One earphone would just switch off while the other still has about 80% of it's battery left. Never seen a worse manufacturing of a product, that too from a reputed company like boat. Waste of money as I can't use the earphones anymore with just one earphone that is working. And there is no way to replce it again. Don't buy it, it's not worth your money.",1.0

I sent the product to them along with the box, all accessories and documents. What came back was a used old product in a bubble wrap!

1507,Don't buy if you want to take calls on ur phone using this.,Very very poor noise cancellation. Sound quality is good and bass is actually it's usp.

It's not as huge shown in the pictures,but very compact which makes it quite easy to fit in the pocket 😃The type c cable helps in fast charging which is one of the highest features of this tws ranking higher than all other tws under 5k..The ear wings make it stiff in the ear which prevents it from falling..The design, build and fitting is truly top-notch..The battery life lasts little longer than 3 hours and case can recharge around 3 times fully and litlle in the 4th time..To talk about the cons:Only few cons though,Truly not suitable for gaming as it does not have a low latency mode compared to redmi or realme buds..The earbuds must be kept properly in the case or else it won't charge 😂There are 3 magnets in the earbuds but only 2 in the case which makes it funny!!!I think I have only such points to talk about and I will update along with the usage..",5.0

1536,Almost there.,"Given the price this is pretty awesome in every aspect. Battery life, fit, quality etc.My only complaint is in the noise cancellation.This doesn’t have active noise cancellation, what it does is when you wear it, due to the very tight fit in the ear it will cut you off from the surroundings which can turn out dangerous if you are on the road or something.On the other end the tight fit helps with the bass which is genuinely perfect.",4.0

This was quite true, its been 3 days that my product has arrived and I am getting problems with calling. As the microphone is in our ears and not near out mouth, our sound to the other person echos and is heard from a distance. So I have to talk louder which is not possible everytime. Even then the sound echos. Rest of the features like noise cancellation and bass quality is upto the mark but honestly that is not my main concern. I bought it for recording youtube videos. I didnot consider the reviews as I am not much into calling and bought it because it came at a fair price. But if you wanna buy this do consider that it is not good for calling purpose what so ever.",3.0

1633,Worth it for the price,"So before this I has used the Bolt truebass, compared to that I can the sound quality is much much better with good bass and clarity, haven't tested call quality yet, overall build quality is also good, only thing is it's a bit difficult while removing it from the case",5.0 
1634,Defective Airdopes received both the time.,I ordered the sporty blue color one first time. As soon as I connected I noticed that there is a continuous noise playing in the left earpiece but no problem with the right one. I thought I had received a defective one so requested the replacement and received a new sporty blue color one again. But again the same issue continuous noise in the background from the left earpiece. I don't know for sure why the problem is happening with the blue ones. I hope the problem won't arise with the Black color ones.But the sound quality is just amazing. The only problem I faced is the noise.,2.0

1639,Mostly Dont work. a Bad Buy. how i Wish i had not bough it!!,"The product looks nice but is tough to use. if it connects to a phone, then it does not leave it and becomes like a leech, when you disconnect, you need to switch off the system to get the control back to the system. it is very unpredictable - you don't know when it will connect to the phone or PC, it just might not. and as it is bought from Amazon, there is no way to get any support .

You will feel that this product is fully worth of money. This product has touch controls and RGB light too. So don't overthink about this product just buy it .",5.0 
1641,Good product,Really good product with good bass and good touch controls. Sometimes left airdope unpairs. For this you have to keep both airdopes back in the charging box and simultaneously press both off them until blue light blinks rapidly. This sets the airdopes back to factory setting. Now pair it again to your bluetooth device and plugin to nirvana!,4.0

1650,Cool product to have. Good quality and design.,Overall it is a value for money product given the price tag of Rs. 2499.Connectivity is very good. Instantly connects with my OnePlus Nord on opening the case.The shark fins fit nicely in the ear. The design of the buds is very elegant. The case is also very compact and neat looking. Battery life is extremely good.The sound output is the only area which needs improvement. It is not very high even at full volume.,4.0 
1651,Warranty Scam,The audio quality of the product seems good. The issue I faced is the battery life. The product was defective. I only noticed it after a month. The left earphone only had a battery backup of around 40 minutes. The nearby service station around my area is 30 Km away. Now for a Rs.2000 product I can't afford to spend money on traveling expenses and waste my day. They also refused door to door service even after advertising such on their site page.,1.0 
1652,Think before buying. Started heating up after using 3 months.,Am reviewing after using 3 months.The sound is not proper after using 2.5 months on right ear bud. It started heating up.Now even the left ear bud start to heat up after listening 5-10 minutes.So think before buying. The sound quality was good intial day but after using for 3 months both the buds were almost gone. Its of no use. Both buds heating up day by day.The one who gave positive comments were those commented when they using intial days. Even i felt the same initial days but now its horrible.,1.0 
1653,Good Earphone for Bass lovers but not a great mic,The earbuds worked great with mobile phone but lost connectivity of sound when paired with laptop multiple times during conference calls.

Reception coverage area is good upto 10 mtrs4. The mic is weak and it takes the person to speak loud when attending the call,3.0

It didn't feel that heavy on ears but the case is definitely a bit heavy because it has 2600 mAh battery which is really huge. Connecting it is very easy and set is also hassle free, just go through the manual once and one will understand all its settings. It has metal hosing which is definitely a very good thing to mention. It has type C charging which is very good in its segment. Overall its a very good product with very good specs. One thing worth mentioning that its made in China product.",4.0

I have not used the pod extensively either. As the Return window is closed, I need to go by the very conventional method of calling their customer care to find a resolution. If I do not get this sorted soon through the warranty period, then no more ""boAt"" products for me anymore.",1.0 
1683,Superb quality . For sound quality I always go with boat,There is only problem that there is stir voice when you are not listening and in a repetitive way on left side sometimes .

They're softer and more delicate, but they still work well and are comfortable. The noise isolation is not as good as the Airdopes 451, but good enough. Bass is better than I expected, and for me, the audio quality stays the same even after increasing the volume.",4.0 
1694,Overall review is below the average and not bad,Comparatively with other products with the same price are good to use.Firstly it took one eternity to connect with my handphone.

Boat airdopes 441 sounded very promising but it has disappointed me a lot,1) the case cover was loose since beginning as you can see in the video it closes just with a tilt.2) The earphones sometimes disconnects while I run for 2-3 seconds.3) It does not have a proper noise cancellation Coz when I speak with someone with the fan on it creates a disturbance.4) Most importantly the earphones are not charging while I put them in the case and they are still connected to my phone even when the case lid is closed.

3613,Amazing Product,The build quality is amazing sound effects is just amazing. It has a premium feel to it. 100% satisfied at affordable price. Loved the product. Highly recommended,5.0 
3614,It is worth to buy but company needs to fix the connectivity issue,The product is quite good in terms of looks and sound quality the bass of the buds is not much but it is okay .Also there is disturbance in the connectivity even the buds and the device are very close,4.0

3617,Worst warranty service of Boat,Was doing good for the 1st month. Thenit stopped working. I applied for warranty and they replaced and provided the wrong model which is way cheaper and inferior than this. (Airdopes 131),1.0 
3618,Do not purchase!!!!!!!,This product had stopped working after the 1 month of usage and when I sent it to boat service center for replacement from more than one month they are telling me that I will receive the product but still not.My 2500 is wasted,1.0 
3619,Its temporary,"Sound quality is very good. But after using for 1.5 months 🔋 life is becoming a problem.  Maybe 1 hr playback time. Both case and earbuds are plasticy and tends to slip from the hand, wish the material was textured.",4.0
